  <Content>&lt;i&gt;As the days grow dim and the nights stretch on, winter's chill drives Aislings and Mundanes alike to keep the yule logs burning throughout the long, dark hours past dusk. It is a maddening task which requires a nightly vigil to drive out the cold. Then in the distant mornings, the dull world is blanketed once more with snow and lidded with endless grey clouds.
One night, without ceremony, you collapse into the little wooden bed and fall into a feather-soft snow drift as delicate flurries flutter down from the starry sky above you. There is an almost magical scent of cookies, peppermints, and evergr�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������een trees fragrancing the air paired with the tinkling sounds of bells and distant laughter.
You wander past a cluster of brightly lit buildings and into the wilderness to muse at mittened wolves and scarved skeletons. As you trek around the mountain, you hardly notice that the cold breezes turn in to frosty winds and the winds turn in to frozen gusts. The tinkling music is long gone, and over the howling of the biting wind is a howling of another sort.
Perhaps you should return to the village. You look down to the powdery snow only to find that your tracks were obscured by the winds. The desire to return to the little cluster of brightly lit buildings is replaced with a fear of being stranded in the wilderness.
You decide to climb higher in order to catch a glimpse at the little village. The grizzly howl ominously pierced the night again just as you arrive at a spit of rock jutting off the side of the mountain slope. Where upon the ridge you are met by the smiling faces of four giant snowmen. They stand still with their coal eyes staring into the valley below you. You pass by them to get closer to the ledge to you seek out any sign of those sweetly twinkling lights below.
You turn around at the sound of the crunching of snow behind you only to see a trivial bit of snow fall from the side of the largest of the five snowmen. With a shrug, you turn back to the slope to make out what seemed to be a slow avalanche. Wait. Five?
You spin around to see not only five towering snowmen, but a massive beast whose imposing body was covered with silver fur. It howled once again with savage ferocity, and you freeze with terror. The snowmen lurch forward. Nine and ten and more appear, advancing upon your petrified form to cut you off from the path down the slope. You shake your head and turn at a dead run to leap off of the rocky outcropping. Your heart thumps heavily in your chest as you near the edge, and just before you bound off of the cliff, you close your eyes and pray to the Octave and Danaan that you may land in the snow. Regardless, any fate is better than being torn limb from limb by the yeti. Just before you hit the icy ground you startle awake. You're alive and safe in your little wooden bed. It was merely a dream. Your heart continues racing for a time as you get your bearings once more, dimly aware that the yule fire burnt out hours ago.
