Kalliope writes: 

&lt;I&gt;A priest of each member of the Trinity appeared at dawn and began long chants of the tales of their arch-deity. 

In Pravat the Grimlok worship Adranuch, their Lady of Gold. In Astrid the Kobolds worship Arpina, their All-Mother. In Mehadi the Mukul worship Matrika, their Goddess of the Sun-heart.&lt;I/&gt;
