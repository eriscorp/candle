  <Title>Saving the Beggars!</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>"During the cold winter, many beggars have fallen to starvation, and even frozen to death. This holiday season, the Piet Priestess, Narve has asked the Suomi Troupe to rally kind Aislings to aide the beggars in Temuair!

So, bring warmth and comfort to the less fortunate and you might get yourself something special!

((The event will be held on 15th December, 9.00pm EST Saturday at Suomi Fountain. As this is a scavenger hunt event, Please empty your inventory for the items.

This event is held by the Suomi Troupe and the usual in-game rules of Suomi apply.)) </Content>
