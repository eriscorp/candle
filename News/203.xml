  <Title>Pet Store Coming Soon</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>&lt;I&gt;Greetings Aislings,

I am pleased to announce my pet store opening soon in the town of Tagor. It is currently under construction and will be opening as soon as it is finished. I have a variety of pets to sell, so start saving up! I also have a pet that has never been seen in the lands of Temuair. Hope to see you all at the Grand Opening.
