  <Title>Gold Bars Are Coming!</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>Hello Aislings,

Tired of lugging your gold coins around? Why not carry one Gold Bar instead. For a small fee, you can have bankers around Temuair melt your gold coins into one massive Gold Bar worth 50 Million gold. Gold Bars are perfect for showing off and purchasing expensive items as well (no more being scammed). You can even sell it back to the banker if you wish. Get yours today!

((Gold Bars will be released on April 1st. Only registered players can access this feature.))
