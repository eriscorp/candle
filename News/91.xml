  <Title>The Eulogy: Octave</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>Kalliope writes an octave in remembrance of Danaan and the cycle that has begun: 

One visited us, our flame-licked lover.
Two made us beautiful, each and everyone.
Three showed us the world as it is.
Four showed us the secrets.
Five showed us their use and art.
Six showed us their fineness.
Seven tore us apart.
Eight led us to the Altar.
