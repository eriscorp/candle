  <Content>Bertil, Fae Priestess of Suomi, speaks of odd travelers:
 
 
&lt;I&gt;A handsome, well-mannered man visited me the moon before last. He spoke in fascinating detail concerning a religious sect that devotes it's time and energy to the worship of the white lady, Danaan.  
 
He carried several books, one of which he called the 'Cáidh Leabhar'.  I only caught a glimpse of it's writings as he thumbed through the pages, but I could see his eyes glisten when he looked down upon the dusty book.  
 
Near the back cover, several pages remained untouched by an inked quill.  I questioned him about the book's abrupt end, and he told �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������me the blank slates were yet to be written... that the events of the future would decide the book's final outcome.
 
Before he departed, the long-haired Aisling invited me to a gathering of worshippers.  The evening of  the 9th moon's 11th day on this Deoch, the thirty-third, was the date he gave to me.  Taking place just outside the Tagorian Chapel, of all places.  
 
A worship of Light near the doorstep of Darkness?
