  <Content>KRU Interactive is offering a character restoration service for 'DARK AGES' characters that were deleted in the character purges that occurred in 2005 and 2006. Restoration for prior years' is not possible at the moment, so please do not send requests if you fall under this category.

Players interested in restoring their purged characters, we ask you to read the below information as well as the instructions (Purged and Deleted Characters) in the Knowledgebase for DARK AGES before sending in your Support Tickets.

- The restoration is a very lengthy process, from the initial inquiry to the final restoration. Although we realize your desire for quick response from us, please submit your ticket only ONCE. We will process and reply to the tickets in the order they come in. Sending in multiple tickets will only delay your process further. Please note the overall process could take up to a month or longer, so we ask for your patience.

- There is a processing fee for the restoration. The fee will be 1 UNUSED COUPON CODE OF (Kruna $29.85/3300Kruna) PER CHARACTER. Only PURCHASE the coupon code AFTER receiving CONFIRMATION from us that the purged character can be restored. 

Please note that this is a fee, and Kruna will not be added to your account.
