  <Content>Suffering from boredom, King Bruce has requested a fireworks show from one of the court jesters. The fireworks show will take place at the steps of Loures Castle, occurring once every Temuairian day(every 3 hours). In conjunction with this event, Areini will be randomly giving away a Pet Wasp to Aislings(registered).

((This event will begin on June 30th and will end on July 5th. On July 4th, the fireworks jester will be selling individual fireworks.))</Content>
