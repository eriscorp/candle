  <Title>Adoration and New Guild System</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>The Adoration Event will be available on June 30th and will run over the July 4th weekend. All characters who performed the Eulogy and/or Redemption may turn in their items and receive their reward at the appropriate Mundanes.

A new guild system will be implemented shortly along with new requirements for forming a guild. The new requirements are: a founder/leader that is a recognized Aisling, two million coins, and a minimum of 15 members. Current and new guilds will also receive a Guild Bank feature where members can contribute gold and view the current balance. Only leaders may withdraw gold from the �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������guild bank. Leaders will also have the option to transfer leaders to another character that meets the requirements. There will be a new requirement to receive a guild board as well, 128 members (no website necessary). Guilds that already have boards do not need to meet this requirement.

For those who cannot meet the requirements to form a Guild can instead form a Fellowship. A fellowship is a smaller version of a guild with a minimum of 5 members and a maximum of 15 members. The requirement for a Fellowship is 1 million coins and a total of at least 5 members. Fellowships do not have banks, cannot transfer leadership, and are not eligible for boards. However, they can upgrade to a guild after meeting the guild requirements.

Any guild(current and new) and fellowship that do not have a leader, or the leader is found to no longer be part of Dark Ages will be disbanded.

All Motleys will be converted to Guilds.</Content>
