&lt;b&gt;Pet Ghost&lt;/b&gt;
"Speak to the one who resurrects the dead. Only he can tame this undead spectre."


&lt;b&gt;The Horseman&lt;/b&gt;
"He appears randomly from town to town searching his head. If you dare attack him, he will hurl at you the face of a demon.


&lt;b&gt;The Red Moon&lt;/b&gt;
"The Red Moon has come to haunt the lands of Temuair. Many Deochs ago, a demon sorcerer was vanquished from Temuair. Before his defeat, the sorcerer placed a curse on the lands, the curse of the Red Moon. The Mundanes were worried at first, but after many Deochs, a red moon never appeared. It was assumed that there was no curse and no one ever spoke of it again. But 40 Deochs ago, a full red moon hovered the sky above Temuair and it returns again. Legend has it, those who stare at the moon will succumb to its power." ((New monster forms will be added)).
