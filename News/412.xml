- The restoration is a very lengthy process, from the initial inquiry to the final restoration. Although we realize your desire for quick response from us, please submit your ticket only ONCE. We will process and reply to the tickets in the order they come in. Sending in multiple tickets will only delay your process further. Please note the overall process could take up to a month or longer, so we ask for your patience.

- There is a processing fee for the restoration. As stated in the Knowledgebase, the fee will be 3 coupon codes. Only PURCHASE the coupons AFTER receiving CONFIRMATION from us that the purged character can be restored. Please note that this is a fee, and will not be applied to any game time. To renew your account, you will need to purchase an additional coupon code.

Nexus will not offer the purge restoration service at this time. Please do not submit tickets related to Nexus characters.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.</Content>
