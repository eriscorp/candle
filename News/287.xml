  <Content>Knighthood

For the first time in Temuair, Loures is granting the title of Knighthood to select Aislings, a position that was once held by only Mundanes.  Knights are keepers of the peace, resolving problems between Aislings. They have a direct line of communication with the Mundanes. They deal with both Aisling law and Mundane law.  Knights do not enforce any form of punishment. They are mediators, if a problem cannot be solved with town officials or Rangers then they can report to the Mundanes using the Knight Board. 

Candidacy
The requirement to become a Knight candidate is at least four Guard Captain terms or curren�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������tly a Ranger. Knights must also be Masters. The name of the candidate will be posted on the Candidate board where Aislings above insight 50 may write their comments of the candidate. The comments can be negative or positive, but any post that is irrelevant, inappropriate, and/or violates Mundane Law will be void and deleted. The Aisling responsible will be arrested and possibly bannished from Temuair. Comments must be valid and supported with examples of actual events. 

The first ten Knights will be selected by the Mundanes. Knights thereafter will be selected by current Knights based on the comments on the candidacy board.

Knights will be given class specific armor and uniform. ((Armors were made exclusively for Dark Ages!!))

Knights can lose their Knighthood if they severely violate Aisling or Mundane Law and/or behave in a manner that is inappropriate of a Knight.

Duty
The main duty of a Knight is to help resolve problems between Aislings, community problems.  Knights may also report other issues such as corrupt political officials, abusers, harassers, problem peasants,etc. ((As wells as bugs))

((Candidates be will contacted by Eduardo by in-game mail.))
