  <Title>Server Down Time - Resolved</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>Hello,

As of 8:11 PM (PST) we believe that the issues with the ISP have been resolved for the most part, and the game should be working correctly now.

We will be adding 1 day to all the active accounts to compensate for this down time.

We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.
