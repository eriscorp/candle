  <Content>Mysteries of the Dubhaim 

Since the breaking of the Seal of Temuair there have been strange occurrences 
in the world of the Dubhaim. Loures scholar Lucius Gaius, an expert on the 
dubhaim, writes:

"With the breaking of the Seal of Temuair the creatures of Dubhaim appear to 
have become more hostile and show increased devotion to their dark lord. The 
fervor concerns me; it would appear the breaking of the seal has opened their 
spirits to something that was cast out of Temuair. Something that is very old 
and forgotten has again penetrated Temuair. What exactly this is remains a 
mystery. If we do����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� not find out what is causing this there is no telling what 
actions they could take.

-Lucius Gaius
Scholar of Loures"

Several important figures have been actively researching this but require 
additional assistance due to the vastness of this mystery. Novus Imperia will 
be coordinating efforts to get aislings groups to help solve this mystery. I 
am told that three seems to be an important number from several sources that 
must be utilized to solve this mystery. 

The group that successfully solves the mystery shall have their legends show 
record of this great deed. We will be coordinating and starting research of 
the groups in several double moons. To solve this mystery will require 
wisdom, strength, and courage. Good luck to all to who try.    

-Lord Ramanayan Caesar
Novus Imperia Guild Leader

((Mysteries of Dubhaim will be held on Friday May 2nd at 5:45 PM PST starting 
at the Dubhaim Castle courtyard. Aislings will form groups of 3, but all in 
the groups must be within one of the following three insight ranges: 11-40, 
41-71, and 71+. Each group -must- sign up with Ramanayan prior to the start 
of the event. The groups will be required to find different locales across 
Temuair, engage in puzzle solving, adventure, task completion and some combat 
if needed. 

The first group that successfully completes the entire mystery will be 
rewarded with a unique legend mark. Unlike previous Novus Imperia events this 
event is scripted and planned differently and should provide a challenge to 
both young and old aislings alike.))
