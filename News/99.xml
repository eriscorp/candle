  <Title>Eulogy Legends Merged</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>The Eulogy legend that appears on the character's legends after participating the last part of the event (on Sunday), created a second legend during the Eulogy in 2000/11. At this time these legends are merged back into the original legend. So, if you perform the Eulogy twice or more (by particpating at more than one year's Thanksgiving), a single legend appears instead of two or more separate legends. The Redemption legends are also merged in this same manner. Now, the merged legend tracks how many times you have participated. This is a necessary technical change. We apologize if it causes you any inconvenience or �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������loss of nostalgia. 

The legends do appear correctly, and do function the same as before. In addition, you now have a legend of the number of times you have performed the Eulogy, and a small increase in the experience points awarded for participation in the Eulogy multiple times at the same site, if your character is level 11 or higher. For example, participating at Astrid the first year and participating the second year at Astrid again, awards more experience. If immediate experience points is a primary interest, participate again at the same site as you did in previous years. Your legend already lists where you participated in previous years.
