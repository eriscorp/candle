  <Content>&lt;u&gt;Purge - May 3&lt;/u&gt;
On Wednesday, the 3rd of May, Kru Interactive will be doing an account database purge. At this time we will be removing all inactive accounts from our database. Inactive accounts are any account that has not been active in the last 32 days leading up to the purge date.
This purge will free up any unused character names so that they will be available to other players to use in the future.
When an account is purged all characters on the account will be deleted from our servers, along with any items, abilities, stats and experience the character may have. To avoid the loss of your character you must����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� make sure your account is actively registered some time between April 3rd and the May 3rd.

&lt;u&gt;Redemption - April 12-19&lt;/u&gt;
The Redemption Ritual will be held on Wednesday, April 12th. It will last through Easter weekend and end on April 19th. When performing the Redemption, the item you received from the Eulogy will be exchanged for an item for the Adoration.

&lt;i&gt;"Three summers ago, Aislings gave worship to one of three deities during the Eulogy ritual. Three unique Eulogies were held: One by the Grimlok of Pravat to Adranuch, their Lady of Gold. One by the Kobolds of Astrid to Arpina, their All-Mother. And one by the Mukul of Mehadi to their Goddess of the Sun-heart.

Just over a moon from now, the Evening Star of Hesperos will align with the smile of Danaan, the sun. The keepers of each worship site have begun preparations to hold the Redemption ritual during the alignment.

History shows us that a gentle Aisling may worship along side the same species that they did during the Eulogy ritual, provided that the Aisling has not slain one of their race and is devote.

The priests of these races seek an artifact bestowed on Aisling-kind during the Eulogy. If given willingly, these rare items will be empowered with the ability to combine together with two unlike its own during the upcoming Adoration ritual.

The priests rely on Aislings to repel any dubhaimid or Anaman interference.
