  <Content>The grave yards of Macabre seem to be over run with zombies as of late. To help clean up the mess we are hosting this event. Are you and your group ready to participate in Zombie Slayer? Speak with "Dislaidir" at Road to House Macabre once the event has started.

((Starting Wednesday October 29th, the Zombie Slayer Event will be released and will last until after Halloween.))
