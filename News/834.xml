  <Title>Dark Ages moving servers!</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>Tomorrow morning we are moving Dark Ages to newer, faster servers! This means that we are going to take the servers down completely between 2-3hrs, although we're going to make the move as fast as possible. This will be occurring at 2AM PST/5AM EST tomorrow, Thursday, April 7th. We will make a post on the website when the move is complete and we apologize in advance for the inconvenience.</Content>
