  <Content>​&lt;I&gt;There was a time when the world was new.

What seems like a lifetime ago I was told that the word "Temuair" came from the fae tongue meaning "earth" and "sea". This is an accurate description of the rugged face of the world that twisted and buckled between an eternal fire below and the frozen winds above. The world was naught but earth and sea and by Grinneal's will came wind and fire. The elements of the ancient times were free and without masters; they were wild and shaped the world that we but walk and tend today.

This was the way of the world in Medenia as it was in the lands you Aislings call "Ardma�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������gh" and "Loures". But in these lands, the world was torn open by the hand of Grinneal to release fire from within the wound of the world. Young and reckless, fire lashed out from beneath the earth with a ferocious rage. Here, angry fire from within was not shielded by the ancient guardian elements of earth and sea, and it readily battled with the equally turbulent and energetic wind.

Hear me, Aisling, the first beings of this world were not these "Aosda" as it was taught in the lands across the great ocean. Though truly, they were the first beings of our fragile form. No, the first inhabitants of Temuair were the elemental spirits. They are immortal and do not wear a cage of flesh as you or I. There were, indeed, several other beings that walked the lands before Aosdian or Mundane feet trod there.

While the world was new and the elemental spirits danced upon the gift of Grinneal, they were granted servants to attend to their wills; thus one by one the first of the baem, or "dragons" as you would call them, were created. These are the ancient ancestors of the Copar, Hydracos, and the Dracos in Temuair, but they single-mindedly obey the orders of the elementals and do not chase their own covetous whims as they do in Temuair.

Wind was the last of the great elements created by Grinneal, and it is said that wind was to pair off with fire as earth and sea had done before them. However the natures of the young spirits of fire and wind were much too wild and willful to exist in harmony with one another, so they clashed at every encounter. Knowing of this grand intention only served to create an eternal chasm between the two elementals and all of their offspring and servants knew nothing but hatred for one another. The spirits of wind kept mostly to itself in the sky and did not associate much with the spirits of earth and sea, however the spirit of fire remained near the caldera at Nageling close to the other spirits and eventually learned the wisdom of balance. As the earth had learned to tremble violently and the seas could crash as monstrous waves, fire had the power to scorch and burn, but it could also warm and thaw the earth and water after the bitter cold had swept through..

​The elements had vibrant personalities and wills of their own  at that time before the chaining, Aisling, and still a shadow of each of their personalities can still be witnessed by those who seek to find them. It was ages ago when most of the elementals became slaves to the beings of the flesh, and so all but the strongest willed elementals became man's hollow tools rather than fully developing into corporeal beings by themselves. The Aosda and mundanes had not ventured onto the shores of Medenia during the chaining of the elements. No, so they did not know the difference between their elemental magic and the power of summoning the elements. The land of Medenia was only populated by the elementals that could resist the pull of Aosdian magic, the baem, and the simple creatures the elementals had created there. So, once the Aosda learned the secrets of the fae, little by little the elemental spirits disappeared and the landscape of both Temuair Medenia became stagnant, barren, and dull. Of all of the elements of this world, one  refused to become enslaved to the will of mortals more than the others. This was the element of the wind.

​When the numbers of the elementals plummeted, the spirits were forced to rely upon their devoted baem more and more frequently. Sometimes, the reliance upon the great serpents was so much that the baem were required to work autonomously. At Nageling the baem of the fire elementals worked tirelessly for an age to fill most of the glowing pit, all but sealing off the glow of the world's inner flame,. Upon the chasm, a great tower was erected in the hopes that their master would someday find peace with the elementals and baem of the wind. This was not to be. For before a great peace could be found, the spirits were being torn from the elementals, draining the weakest of them of their essence and free will.

​Earth, Sea, and Fire, having learned the power in harmony, they discovered how to coalesce into the great spirits we can speak to today, however the spirits of the wind were incensed by the chaining of the elements, and their baem were instructed to "go forth and tear all those who would challenge us asunder". Unswervingly, the baem of wind still follow that directive, and they have viscously slain many of my people, the baem gadeu of fire as well as most or all of our emissaries the baem gadeu of earth and sea. We have not heard from them for many years. ​As far as I know we are the last of the baem gadeu riding the last of the baem that are not sworn to serve the wind elementals. And now they seek to kill the last of us in our home, the ancient tower of Nageling. We are not even safe here in our sanctum.

I should warn you, Aisling, that while most of the baem of the air distrust and loathe beings of the flesh, they seem to have found fanatical followers who seek to destroy the rest of those who walk Grinneal's creation in order to fight alongside them. Those poor fools do not realize that they will be slain once their enemies lay dead. It is a far less cruel death to allow them to die before they are betrayed by those they follow thoughtlessly. These mundanes will not surrender or yield to you as you fight them. Do not show them mercy for they will not have any for you.&lt;I/&gt;
