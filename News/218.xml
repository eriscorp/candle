  <Content>"Hungry for some cherries, I traveled to the town of Suomi. It was quiet as usual not as bustling as Mileth or Rucesion. As I was walking through the town, I noticed this strange path leading into some dense trees.There was a huge river blocking my way to the path. Using my great ability to swim, I jumped into the river and swam my hardest.The river was cold, and the current mild at best. I was able to reach the other side with little effort. Cold, and dripping I slowly crept towards the path.
I tried to peek through the dense tress but could not see anything. Staring through the trees, I started to hear strange noises. Th�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������e sounds of large insects and the growling of wolves. Then I saw something, a shadow of a creature. I peered closer, and closer. Then something grabbed me....

Decasco:Ahhhh!

Farmer: Sorry lad, didn't mean to scare ya.

Decasco: Me scared? No sir, you just startled me.

Farmer: What are you looking at?

Descasco: This hidden path.

Farmer: Hidden? This path has always been in Suomi, but hardly anyone notices it. 

Descasco: Really? Well then why is it covered behind these trees? And why is there no way to cross the river to get to it? Wait a minute. Why are you not wet? How did you get to the otherside of the river?

Farmer: I just crossed the bridge.

Descasco: Bridge? What bridge?

Farmer: Yes, the one right over there.

Sure enough there was a large bridge a few yards from where I jumped into the river. The Gods are toying with me, I swear on it.

Decasco: So where does this path lead to?

Farmer: Porte Forest. It is not like the other forests that surrounds Suomi. It is strange and dangerous. No one ever dares enter it anymore. Long ago there was a family of three who decided to live in the forest.

Decasco: Why would a family want to live in a dangerous forest.

Farmer:  It was not dangerous when they went in, something happened and the forest started to change.

Decasco: Hmmmm...so what happened to them?

Farmer: I do not know, it was story told to me by my father. If you are thinking of entering Porte, I suggest you have an Aisling escort you. You will probably have to pay them millions of gold coins, seeing how they are nowadays.

Decasco: Is it that dangerous?

Farmer: I doubt it, nothing a master cannot handle. But I am sure it will tough for those lower insights. Anyway, I have some farming business to get back to. If you want to know more ask the other merchants of Suomi. Good day.

Decasco: Good day to you too.

So here I sit next to a fireplace, drying off, writing about my re-discovery of Porte Forest.

Decasco,
The Wandering Mundane
