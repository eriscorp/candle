  <Content>Hello Aislings!

Is it Leprechaun Season? I just caught a glimpse of one lurking around my shop. I heard other Aislings seeing them around other villages as well. If you have never seen one before, come drop by in the "Suomi Weapon Shop." I might be able to help you if you want to try and catch one.
