Save its leader Jean the entire Loures High Council has been assassinated!

Details remain sketchy, but it would seem that the council was meeting with generals Dealos and Tiberius on the state of the Goblin War. At some point after the two generals left a horrible spell descended on the chamber literally causing flesh to decay into nothingness. It was also reported that those in rooms near the council chambers were also affected, to a much lesser extent, by what killed the council. Priests and surgeons arriving on the scene reported they had never seen anything like it before.

Jean, the leader of th�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������e council, was unable to attend the session due to illness according to sources close to the royal court.

Loures has no shortage of enemies with a motive and the means to have carried out this assassination. Undine Rebels, the Necromancer Order, the Anaman Pact, and the Goblins have all been speculated as the responsible party.

No suspects have been named. Lord Gnaeus Ramanayan Caesar and his entourage will be coordinating an investigation and response to this atrocious crime. All aislings are encouraged to aide in the investigation."

Grey Council will be held on Friday September 8th at 5:00 PM PST (6 MST, 7 CST, 8 EST). The event will begin at the memorial of Cedric in Loures Harbor.

For more details on the factions and history involved visit the official event site at http://www.novus-imperia.com/events/greycouncil/greycouncil.htm

Participating players will form groups of three for the event. All participants must be over insight 11.
Once the event has begun players will engage in an epic adventure spanning all across Temuair. It will include puzzle solving, exploration, combat, diplomacy, political intrigue, and much more. Grey Council will feature a rich and unique plot filled with twists and turns, references to Temurian history and culture, and much more.

The first groups to successfully complete specific objectives (unknown to the participants) during the event shall be rewarded with one of four unique legend marks created for Grey Council. Due to the structure of the event it will not be possible for one group to win more then one legend mark. Winners will be informed at the end of the event.

Legend marks will then be added by Kru in time.

Unlike previous Novus Imperia events all of the groups will be able to complete the event.

Finally, the most important new feature we have added in Grey Council is the ability to choose. Completely non-linear in nature it will be up to each individual group how to proceed. Depending on the choices each group makes during the event their overall experience will be different from the next group.

Its been nearly a year since our last event, Saga of the Darkness, and we have taken the time to make Grey Council into what we hope will be Novus Imperias best hosted event yet.

(And for those whove attended our previous events youll now be dealing with fully interactive characters - no more mundanelings with set lines!) ))</Content>
