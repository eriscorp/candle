  <Content>&lt;b&gt;Guild Hunting Event&lt;/b&gt;

To promote hunting with your guildmates, we're putting in a new feature that gives groups of 5 people or more from the same guild a 25% experience bonus. Grab 4 (or more!) of your best friends from your guild and enjoy the bonus experience.

This event will Start on September 25th and END on September 30th. We hope you enjoy this event since this feature might be added permanently (with lower EXP bonus). Applies ONLY to registered players. :)
