    It has come to my attention that people have been starting to find and pick various flora of the woodlands in the Finach region.  Not knowing the true names of these flowers, the system used by Higglers to identify seems to have been applied.  While Higglers are most adept at sorting and storing items, they do not have much knowledge in names nor the histories attached thereto.  To alleviate this oversight, I have researched these and other flora from around Temuair to find their true histories and names for those who choose to seek out the flowers of the world.

((New �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������flowers have been added, along with the flowers from the PlanetDA and DA Eternal contests. You can get them from their native regions. Some are useful, some are not, some are just for fun.

Also, arrest limit has been reduced from 9 to 6. That means that any Aisling with 6 or more arrests will have their character (not account) exiled from Dark Ages for an extended period of time.
