  <Content>&lt;b&gt;Fireworks!&lt;/b&gt;

Suffering from boredom, King Bruce has requested a fireworks show from one of the court jesters. Francis, the fireworks jester, will appear in front of Loures Castle and perform a fireworks show once every Temuairian day (every 3 hours). Francis will also be selling fireworks (for in-game gold).

&lt;b&gt;Sun Protection&lt;/b&gt;

To protect Aislings from the scorching weather, Francis will also be giving away a "Sun Protection" package. Since the Paradise Event is opening early, Aislings will need protection from the sun.

Francis will be available until July 7th.))

&lt;b&gt;Paradise Event&lt;/b&gt;

"Feeling a bit tired lately? Getting worn from killing monsters in those heavy armors, wielding those large blades? Getting stressed dealing with Aisling complaints? If you answered yes to these question, then come on down and relax in Paradise! Beautiful white sandy beaches with miles of blue ocean waters. Take a nice swim in the cool clear waters, or have a nice refreshing cocktail right on the beach. We have many activities in store for you. You can go fishing for special fish that only inhabit these waters. For the adventurous, you can search for buried chests, containing valuable treasures."

&lt;b&gt;Beach Attire&lt;/b&gt;

To celebrate the opening of Paradise Event, Ruba will be handing out FREE beach attire to all aislings that visit.
