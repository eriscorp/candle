  <Title>Eulogy: Octave</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>Kalliope writes a new octave in remembrance of Danaan and the cycle that has begun:

&lt;I&gt;One gave us our eyes and taught us how to see.
Two comforted our sight.
Three showed us the beauty of the world.
Four gave a glimpse of knowledge.
Five protected our gift with reason.
Six revealed the hidden.
Seven showed us the battle.
Eight made us wish we had never seen at all.
