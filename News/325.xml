  <Title>Peasant Day</Title>

  <Content>Peasants are the hardest working Aislings, living a life full of toil. 
Their toil get the crops to market, keeps the mundane children and 
elderly in good health and even provides for the furthering of 
alchemical research.  Each and every mighty master Aisling that walks 
the lands was at one point a humble peasant.  In days past, peasant 
Aislings had nothing to look forward to but a mundane life full of toil. 
Many Deochs ago, a humble peasant set out to prove that peasants are 
every bit as inspired an Aisling as those who have journeyed through the 
Temple of Choosing.  It was on the 11th sun of the 5th moon of����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� the 23rd 
Deoch that this peasant reached the highest of insights, proving that 
there are no heights to which a peasant cannot climb. It is nigh on the 
three cycle anniversary of this fateful day. In memorandum of this 
momentous achievement, peasants across the land are declaring the 
eightday of this anniversary ((Sunday, October 17th)) Peasant 
Appreciation Day. Observe this holiday, if you will, by wearing once 
more the simple shirt or blouse you started your journey of light in, 
and join others in celebration of your humble origins.
((There is a play planned for around 2pm PT, a scavenger hunt at about 
3pm PT, and a prayer held at 6pm PT))
