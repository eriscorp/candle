"Bored with just sitting on his throne, King Bruce has decided to host a pig chasing event in the Lover's Maze Garden. Any Aisling that can successfully capture a male and female piglet will receive a legend mark, Star Medal, a chance to get an Ability and Experience Gift and other prizes."

((Pig Tokens will be removed after the event is over.))

-Jay, Loures Court Jester

((This event will begin on Wednesday, November 16th and END on Monday, December 5th. For registered players only. Event is repeatable.))
