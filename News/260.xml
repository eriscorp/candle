&lt;b&gt;How to Enter&lt;/b&gt;

1. Complete the work yourself. 

2. Submit your entry here (&lt;a href mailto="DA-Win@DarkAges.com"&gt;DA-Win@DarkAges.com&lt;/a&gt; with entry title in the Subject line) before the 11:59 p.m. (PST) of the deadline date. It is preferable that submissions are sent in electronically. If that is not possible, entries may be sent to the address below. Any art mailed to Nexon will become the property of Nexon and will not be returned.

2855 Kifer Road, Suite 100
Santa Clara, CA 95051

3. Entries will be voted on by the Nexon Art Department (creators of the current official art and website for Dark Ages).

4. You may resubmit any entry before the deadline. Please title it the same and do not congest the inbox with frequent re-entries. 

You must be the original artist of the work and may not include any element that you did not create and do not currently hold the copyright to. Submitting states that you are the artist of the work, have rights to it, and are giving unrevokable rights to use such work in conjunction with Dark Ages by Nexon. Plagiarism is not permitted in a Dark Ages contest. If you submit a work that is not yours, your account can be subject to being cancelled without reimbursement and, if applicable, prosecution. 

This contest replaces the prior contests. If you entered an entry recently into the old contest, you may re-enter it into this one. 

Nexon employees are not eligible to enter. Contest rules are subject to change at any time without notice by Nexon. 

The contest contact address is only used for contests and is not read until after the deadline date. So, please do not direct your customer support requests here. Direct requests to support ((&lt;a href ="http://www.darkages.com"&gt;http://www.darkages.com&lt;/a&gt;). 

&lt;B&gt;Prizes&lt;/B&gt;

The winning characters receive (greatest award first): 

Aisling: Nobility (unique clothes), Legend. Experience Points, Clout. 
Kingdom: Legend. Experience Points, Clout. 
Village: Legend. Experience Points, Clout. 
Clave: Legend. Experience Points, Clout. 
On the scheduled date, the winners will be announced. If you win, find the mundane in the game that offers the award you won, such as Aisling Bard for winning the grand prize of a story contest. 

&lt;U&gt;Legend&lt;/U&gt;

Permanent fame and prestige in the game. Your character gains a unique legend of the award, which is exclusively offered by a contest. Some quests and abilities reward you for these exclusive legends. 

&lt;U&gt;Nobility&lt;/U&gt;

Nobility points can be collected to gain unique, noble garments. 

&lt;U&gt;Noble Garments&lt;/U&gt;

The Loures Lady and Loures Lord garment is offered only to the most noble Aislings. There is no other source of this garment. 

The garment is tailored to your body, so may not be worn by anyone else, nor may be deposited with a mundane. 

Nobility is gained through imagination and education. Aisling works in the library and teaching college classes increase your nobility. See Jean in Loures to learn details on nobility as well as information on teaching college classes. </Content>
