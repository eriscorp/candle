  <Title>Death of Cedric</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>&lt;I&gt;It saddens me to inform you that Cedric will no longer be the Burgess of Mileth. He was recently murdered by Law. I will do some research and gather as much information as I can about where Law came from and how this all came about. But I must ask that all Aislings prepare for Law and his army of dark Aislings. It is likely that they are of equal power to you if not more. You must search for the Grand Armors of Temuair. Your journey begins at the door of the Oren Ruins.
