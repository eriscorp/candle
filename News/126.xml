  <Title>Abandoned Village not so Abandoned?</Title>

  <Content>&lt;i&gt;
Today I was exploring the village of Muc-Mor.  Imagine to my surprise when I stumbled on an actual sentient being.  Short, smelly, and rather blunt he kept demanding to know where my women were.. I left hurridly deciding I would rather fight a goblin.
