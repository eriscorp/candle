  <Content>Greeting Aislings,

The Suomi Inn is now seeking an aisling with the inspiration to remedy the abysmal meals currently being served. In order to find the best chef in the lands a competition is to be held.

Those interested in displaying their culinary skills and competing in the contest should send a letter to a member of the Suomi Troupe. The letter should include a recipe, with a limit of one recipe per aisling, of your own creation. The aislings who submit the "10 best" recipes will be selected and will compete in a live showing of their dish.

Please remember that the kitchens in our Inn are highly �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������understocked and as such contestants should have in their possession any ingredients they use in their recipe, or any items used in its presentation. We wish you the best of luck and look forward to tasting your creations.

- Eeva and Iiro

(( Please note that in order to compete in this event you must have a Dark Ages account; players with accounts which are expired are still eligible. Submissions will be reviewed from February 2nd to February 16th, and judging will follow in the week immediately afterward, with a date for the event itself to follow shortly. Please remember that, as was noted above, the troupe will not be providing any items to be used in this event. All aislings who submit recipes should have access to any and all items used.))</Content>
