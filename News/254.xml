  <Content>		Guilds, old and new.  Take heed, for this could be your shining day.


	Think your guild is the strongest in Temuair?  Really?  Well, prove it.  
Taking place this Deoch will be the Arena hosted Guild Warfare.  Your guild 
will partake in a ladder event where you fight the other strong guilds of 
the land.  It will takes guts, courage and a whole lot of iocs to keep you 
going up the ladder to victory.  Still not quite impressed?  Well, here is 
more.


	Teams will be pre-organized into teams of 10.  The team must have- 3 
casters, 6 bashers and 1 archer.  The guild is allowed to have 1 sub in 
caster,����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 2 sub in bashers, and a sub in archer from round to round to rotate 
in/out current members. (ex: after a round is done, basher A is swapped with 
basher B for the next round.) Once the tournament has been setup and guilds 
called to battle, the matches will consist of:  a best 6/10 rounds.  For at 
least 3 rounds, the guilds will be split up into sub teams.  These sub teams 
must have 1 caster, 3 bashers and 1 archer.  After each of the rounds are 
over, the sub teams must rotate in new members.  After about 3-4 rounds of 
sub team matches, the guild will be put together and the last rounds of the 
match will be fought full guild, first with a 10 on 10, then the deciding 
round of the win or loss, your guild will all be allowed to fight at once in 
a 16 on 16.  The winners move up the ladder.


	Since this is warfare, the rules will be minimal in regards to skill use.  
anything may be used, except a few exceptions that will be made clear at the 
match.  There are however, team rules.  If the team has more than 1 pure 
caster, then they must substitute him for a different caster.  So, you may 
have only 1 pure priest/bard.  The winners of the tournament will recieve a 
legend mark, "Guild Warfare Champions." by the mundanes, and will also 
recieve a title of strongest arena guild to the people.

	If you are interested, send your applications to Kydilias.

	We will be waiting for you.
