  <Content>I received a letter from a little girl name Kalliope a few suns ago. I'm not quite certain how to aid her, but I wanted to share it with you:

"Dear Eeva,

A Deoch ago, I found a baby mouse behind one of the ale barrels in the Undine Tavern. I knew Chloe would have gotten rid of him if she knew, so I made him a new home outside behind the tavern in one of the bushes. I always brought him scraps of food, and kept him warm with some of the rags that were going to be thrown out. I named him Pudgy, and I have had him ever since.

Lately, he's been acting strange. At first, I thought he had just gotte�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������n used to me, because he no longer nips at my fingers when I try to pick him up. But then I noticed he wasn't as lively as he used to be. He sleeps a lot more, and is very sluggish when he does move.

Damara's old cat got sick once, and it refused to eat or drink for days. But Pudgy is still eating as much as before, if not more.
I really don't know what to think. I can't tell Chloe, because she would get mad at me for keeping it.

Do you think you could help me?

Hopeful,
Kalliope"


Perhaps you could visit her and see what you can do for her. Kalliope is usually at the tavern in Undine.


Thank you,
