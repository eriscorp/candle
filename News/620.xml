&lt;b&gt;Try your luck at Veltain Mines!&lt;/b&gt;
Investing a smaller amount of gold in to a Veltain Treasure Chest or Heavy Veltain Treasure Chest might cause you to end up with more gold than you put in�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������.

&lt;b&gt;Canal Treasure Bags just got a bit "Bigger" and a lot "Heavier"!&lt;/b&gt;

Monsters in Oren Ruins, Shinewood Forest, and Mount Giragan all have a little more gold.

The Druid skill Raging Attack is a little less violent.

&lt;b&gt;Team Arena, Beta 2.0&lt;/b&gt;
