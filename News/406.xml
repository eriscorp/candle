  <Content>&lt;b&gt;Paradise&lt;/b&gt;
"Feeling a bit tired lately? Getting worned from killing monsters in those heavy armors, wielding those large blades? Getting stressed dealing with Aisling complaints? If you answered yes to these question, then come on down and relax in Paradise! Beautiful white sandy beaches with miles of blue ocean waters. Take a nice swim in the cool clear waters, or have a nice refreshing coctail right on the beach. We have many activities in store for you. You can go fishing for special fish that only inhabit these waters. For the adventerous, you can search for buried chests, containing valuable treasures."

&lt;b&gt;Pet Erbies&lt;/b&gt;
"A few Deochs ago, these erbies were close to extinction because of my carelessness. Now, thanks to the help of Aislings gathering erbie berries in Medenia, the erbie population is now thriving! To celebrate, I will be randomly giving away pet erbies. Good luck!"

((This event will start on Wednesday, Aug. 23rd and will end on Monday, Aug. 28th. Kru Interactive will also be giving away our plush Erbie toys to players who have received the in-game pet erbies. Supplies are limited, so the first players to send in a ticket with the name of the character that received the pet erbie will be sent an erbie toy from Kru. One player will receive the Mother Erbie. We have logs of who receives the in-game pet. Only registered characters can receive the in-game pet and plush toy.))</Content>
