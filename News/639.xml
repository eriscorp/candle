&lt;b&gt;***Pet Ghost***&lt;/b&gt;
"Speak to the one who resurrects the dead. Only he can tame this undead spectre."

&lt;b&gt;***The Horseman***&lt;/b&gt;
"He appears randomly from town to town searching his head. If you dare attack him, he will hurl at you the face of a demon.

&lt;b&gt;***The Red Moon***&lt;/b&gt;
"The����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� Red Moon has come to haunt the lands of Temuair. Many Deochs ago, a demon sorcerer was vanquished from Temuair. Before his defeat, the sorcerer placed a curse on the lands, the curse of the Red Moon. The Mundanes were worried at first, but after many Deochs, a red moon never appeared. It was assumed that there was no curse and no one ever spoke of it again. But 40 Deochs ago, a full red moon hovered the sky above Temuair and it returns again. Legend has it, those who stare at the moon will succumb to its power."

&lt;b&gt;***The Count and Countess of Macabre***&lt;/b&gt;
The Count and Countess of Macabre have come to Temuair. They are a dangerous and evil couple. The Count is an emotional monster with an affinity towards bats. The Countess is a deceptively beautiful monster, but in the right light you will see her true nature. They will leave a path of death and destruction if they are not dealt with. The Mundanes ask all Aislings to help rid this evil pair from our land. Items won't break on death or won't perish on death in this map.
