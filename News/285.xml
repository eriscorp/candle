  <Content>On Saturday, January 24th the following will be updated for Dark Ages:

1)Fixed Arena Wins - Players no longer have to step on a tile to receive their wins. Once the host casts a win, players of the winning team will automatically receive their mark and teleport to their starting location. Losers will also be teleported as well.

2) Fixed Filter Skipping - Using "Tab" within the text will no longer bypass the curse filter. However, any text that is part of the curse filter will delete any tab and space within the sentence. For example, "Lol that was funny" will result in "Amusingthatwasfunny".

3) Loures Castle����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� - Since all of the towns got a face lift, King Bruce got jealous and decided to re-model Loures Castle.
