  <Content>The hidden whispers of a rebellion in Undine have spread farther than imagined. The members of the Resistance have been growing stronger, as more people have joined in to fight the tyranny of Loures. This has alerted those that are loyal to King Bruce, and Loures has developed a plot to infiltrate these secret rebellion meetings. Rumors among the Resistance speak of such a betrayal, but there is no way for them to know which of their members are actually Loyalists and reporting to the Crown.

The current leader of the Resistance has devised a plan, a way to slowly claim the territory away from Loures. However, if the pl�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������an fails, their own territory will be diminished, but they will be that much closer in figuring out which of the group has betrayed them. Who will be victorious in this struggle for dominance? Will the Loures Agents be discovered? Will the Resistance be able to weaken Loures enough to take down the Crown? The only way to find out is to join us.

((Join us in Suomi on Monday, December 6th at 12pm PST/3pm EST for yet another game of intrigue, deduction, and possibly flat out lying if you're into that. Any and all people are welcome to come. The more the merrier, as you will. The rules of the game will be discussed prior to the event starting.

As this is a Suomi Troupe event, and upon the grounds of Suomi, heresy/OOC chatter will not be tolerated.

Prizes may be awarded based on participation. Information about prizes will not be offered on request, so do not ask.)) </Content>
