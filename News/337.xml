  <Title>Erbie Swarm</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>    A terrible thing I have done this day. I have unleashed a horde of Erbies upon the land of Temuair! Recently, my grandfather, Peltzer, returned from his trip to Medenia. During his trip he wanted to get me a nice souvenir. Knowing my affection for pets, he was able to obtain a cute little Erbie. They are a rare species in Medenia, because they are prey to the desert foxes. But what my grandfather did not know was that they can self-reproduce at an alarming rate. They are overruning the lands, and no creature in Temuair will eat the Erbies. I need your help Aislings!
