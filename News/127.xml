  <Title>Reminder: Character purge on 03/19/2002!</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>On Tuesday morning, the 19th of March Nexon will be doing a character purge of the Dark Ages user database. All characters that have been unregistered for a month will be removed from our database, and the game server.

If you wish to save your characters please make sure you register them again between now and 2002/03/19! Any characters purged CANNOT be restored; the only way to keep your character safe during this purge it to make sure the character is on a registered account!
