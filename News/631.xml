  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>On May 26th between 8:00AM-8:30AM PST, there will be a scheduled server reset. The servers will be down for about 3 hours. Thank you for your cooperation.

**The server maintenance is taking longer than expected, but we are working to minimize the downtime and hope to get the DA servers back up shortly.**
