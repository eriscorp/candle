  <Title>Loures Harbor and the Seal of Temuair</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>The heroic efforts of all Aislings have forced back the army of the renegade, Law, and crushed the Dark Aislings under his command.  The final remnants of his army were crushed thereafter and the Spark of Light was safe once more.  Temuair rejoiced as one! Construction of Loures Harbor has been completed.

No sooner had the revels of celebration died down than it was discovered that all was not well. Aislings were now poised to embark on new long-range merchant ships to reach the new land of Medenia.  The Port of Loures was constructed �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������and the first ships set out to establish contact .. Every ship ... every one ... disappeared.  Thinking that they fell prey to freak storms at sea, more ships were sent out and were stopped by a mysterious barrier.  Soon, strange portents were seen by Sages and Seers from throughout the land.

Agents of he King of Loures, representatives of the Temple's, and mages from the ancient schools of magic set out on a difficult  mission of discovery.  After much sacrifice, great danger, and loss of life the following was discovered:

Temuair had been cut off from the world by a magical barrier of incredible power.  Law, had seen through on his threat to deny Aislings the land of Medenia.  Four seals of power now lay between the new lands and the Lands of Light, Temuair.  Creants most foul stand guard, ready to rip asunder any who face them. 

These seals can be broken, but the way is difficult and fraught with great peril.

Only those Aislings of the highest principal, courage, and ability should attempt to break these seals and destroy the foul magics that now wall off Medenia from Temuair. The source of this great Seal lies withing the depths of Lynith Sea.


"Alas, the trials and tribulations which We had thought over, now continue.  I hereby decree that those brave souls who face this latest danger, and break the seals of power separating us from the land of Medenia will have statues erected in their honor at the Loures Harbor for all to see!  The lands will never forget these heroes!"

King Bruce


((Release: Friday, March 14  
This is a difficult quest. To begin, players must form groups of 5 with one of each path per group. Players will have 5 minutes to defeat each of the Guardians and Creants. The first group to complete the quest will open the path to Medenia! That group will get legend marks and an in-game statue for each. Again, this is a difficult quest, no resets will be given and no death piles returned. Strategy and preparation will be the key to this quest. We haven't forgotten the lower insight Aislings either. Read about Porte Forest.))
