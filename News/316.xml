Vindication is hosting a chance for all those Aislings with the prettiest and most manly outfits.  Let your creative Spark shine, and show Temuair your best design!

The audition date is set as ((September 24th, 2004)) by whispering and setting up and appointment with the aisling Youlanda on that date.  If any other arrangements must be made (i.e. can't make it) please mail her and let her know, so the situation may be amended.

Thank you for your support!
