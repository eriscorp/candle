  <Content>&lt;b&gt;Spring Floppy Event&lt;/b&gt;

There have been rumors of a giant creature on the outskirts of Mileth. Aingeal heard it from the beggar, Teague, in the Mileth Tavern a few suns ago; however, I wouldn't trust anything coming from that old run-down drunkard. 

Some of the farmers, though, are becoming concerned about their crops; this creature is said to be able to devour entire fields in the matter of moments! 

Im not going to get all caught up in it, but you may want to see what he has to say. Teague does have a tendency to be right about these things.

&lt;b&gt;Redemption&lt;/b&gt;

Three summers ago, Aislings gave worship to one of three deities during the Eulogy ritual.  Three unique Eulogies were held: One by the Grimlok of Pravat to Adranuch, their Lady of Gold. One by the Kobolds of Astrid to Arpina, their All-Mother. And one by the Mukul of Mehadi to their Goddess of the Sun-heart.

Just over a moon from now, the Evening Star of Hesperos will align with the smile of Danaan, the sun.  The keepers of each worship site have begun preparations to hold the Redemption ritual during the alignment.

History shows us that a gentle Aisling may worship along side the same species that they did during the Eulogy ritual, provided that the Aisling has not slain one of their race and is devote.

The priests of these races seek an artifact bestowed on Aisling-kind during the Eulogy.  If given willingly, these rare items will be empowered with the ability to combine together with two unlike its own during the upcoming Adoration ritual.

The priests rely on Aislings to repel any dubhaimid or Anaman interference.
