&lt;b&gt;Adoration Event&lt;/b&gt;

Carnig, Solada, and Sunreet reappear to consumate the adoration of Arpina, Adranuch, and Matrika.

Through the sacrifice of the three relics by trinity worshippers who have consecrated their spirit by Redemption, each may invoke the spirit of Danaan within their own heart. Come and worship in threes throughout this Temuairan Moon.

As a scripture says, May our actions be Danaan's smile, may our thoughts be Danaan's brilliance, may Danaan's smile appear upon each that you meet, for she resides in each Aisling's heart. You can only find Her--beginning with faith--or deny Her in whomever you meet.

Blaise
Librarian of Loures

((Adoration will begin on May 25th and end on June 1st. Register your account to participate in this Event.))
