  <Title>Missing Greaves</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>&lt;I&gt;To Aislings,

   If you haven't noticed, certain greaves have been disappearing in Temuair. Intially it was thought that thieves were responsible, but after much research I believe some sort of magic was used. Do not worry, your greaves will be returned to you in a couple days. I will investigate further.
