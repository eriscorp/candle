  <Title>Cedric's Unknown Journey</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>To Aisings,

I have spent the past Deoch doing some research, talking to various Mundanes and reading Cedric's notes. Here is what I have discovered. A few Deochs ago, Cedric, weary from his duties as Burgess of Mileth, decided to take a sabbatical and venture into the sea void beyond the ports of Loures. The Gods did all they could to divert Cedric's course, creating terrible storms, with huge waves and gusting winds. But Cedric continued on. The Gods even tried to make him forget what he was doing, but their power over him grew weaker as he sailed further from Temuair. He eventually landed on an uncharted la�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������nd called Medenia. Medenia was hidden from the Aislings. The gods wanted Aislings to only know all that is Temuair. Not much is known of the events that occurred there, but that is where he met Law. Law presented himself as quite friendly. Little is known about Law except that he is a descendant of the Creants. Long ago a race known as the Creants invaded Temuair. They were so powerful that the Gods had to intervene and stop them. I will continue on with my research.
Law's deadline is drawing closer. He will soon be here with his army of dark Aislings. You must hurry and gather the Grand Master items. Your journey continues in the Sewer Maze of Oren and the snowy mountain peaks of Giragan. ((Opens January 31))
