  <Title>Network Compensation</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>Due to the network issues we experienced a couple of weeks ago, we are compensating all registered accounts on Friday, February 20th with 400 Kruna. Accounts must be registered on the morning of the 20th. We have improved our network which will hopefully improve overall game play in Dark Ages. We appreciate your support.
