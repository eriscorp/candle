  <Title>Erbie Extinction</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>"Oh no, another terrible thing has happened. All of the Erbies have been slaughtered! And now they are extinct in Temuair and possibly Medenia. I didn't realize Aislings were such great hunters, I may have over reacted when they were mutliplying. Now I must face the burden of being responsible for the extinction of entire species! The only hope now is to go to Medenia and find an Erbie Berry. Grandfather Peltzer says that they are grown from the seed of an Erbie Berry. Can you help me again Aislings?
