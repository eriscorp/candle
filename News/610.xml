  <Title>The Dubhaim</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>Beneath looming Mount Giragan lies the idyllic village of Suomi. There is little to worry the small population that resides there; perhaps someone stepping on the grape vines, or some rowdy storytelling in the tavern, or being bothered yet again to secretly create a bouquet of flowers for the lovely Bertil. The days are lazy and peaceful, and the nights are quiet and relaxing.

Until now.

The unearthly howls of the Dubhaim have been echoing across the fields, setting everyone on edge. Even the calls from the wolves in nearby Porte Forest are nothing in comparison. There are claw marks in the wood at the door of the inn,����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� causing Eeva to worry about more than just her hair. The shuffling and shadows by the windows have grown closer and with more frequency. The village has been turned upside down in fear, and with good reason.

Just this morning a young girl was found torn apart by the same clawmarks that have been plaguing the buildings. A hunting party went on a search to find this monster, only to find a stash of potions that would make this beast appear to be like any other Aisling. Something must be done to stop the creature, and soon, before the rest of the town succumbs to the same grisly fate.


((Join us in Suomi on Wednesday, November 17th, at 3pm EST for this game of intrigue, deduction, and possibly flat out lying if you're into that. Any and all people are welcome to come. The more the merrier, as you will. The rules of the game will be discussed prior to the event starting.

As this is a Suomi Troupe event, and upon the grounds of Suomi, heresy/OOC chatter will not be tolerated.

Prizes may be awarded based on participation. Information about prizes will not be offered on request, so do not ask.)) </Content>
