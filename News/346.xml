  <Content>New Company Name 

Nexon, Inc. is now Kru Interactive, Inc. We have spun off from Nexon Corporation and become 100% independent. We are free to make decisions as it fits to our goals and dreams, as well as yours, our players.

Our existing customers need not be alarmed by this change. We will continue to service and support all of your favorite games: Nexus TK, Dark Ages, and Shattered Galaxy. We have business rights to continue existing service with far greater flexibility and autonomy. You are our valued customer, and our top priority is to provide you with the game support and customer service like no other. That �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������is precisely why we are so thrilled about the changes that have occurred within!

To celebrate this exciting moment, we have prepared some great events and upgrades for our games that are sure to interest you. So please visit our site and look around. If you have been away from our games for a while, this would be a great time to come back and check out what is happening with our community!

From all of us at Kru Interactive (www.krugames.com), we thank you for being our loyal customer, and we look forward to serving you for many years to come.

Dark Ages Event

Through the fire deserts of Noam, beyond the heat-stroking dunes, nestled near a bellowing volcano lies Alsaids, the next town of Medenia. Within Alsaids lies new areas to discover, Mundanes to interact with, monsters to battle, and quests to overcome. Alsaids will also provide two new features, the Combo Skill for the Druid class and the Bard's Tunes for the Bard class. The update will occur on April 4th.


Character Purge

On Monday, the 2nd of May, Kru Interactive will be doing an account database purge. At this time we will be removing all inactive accounts from our database. Inactive accounts are any account that has not been active in the last 32 days leading up to the purge date.

This purge will free up any unused character names so that they will be available to other players to use in the future.

When an account is purged all characters on the account will be deleted from our servers, along with any items, abilities, stats and experience the character may have.

We will not be able to restore any account or character that has been purged! To avoid the loss of your character you must make sure your account is actively registered some time between now and the 2nd of May.
