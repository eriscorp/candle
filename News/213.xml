  <Content>Greetings,

       The Battle with Law and his army is drawing nearer. Remember, you must have defeated all four Creants to even stand a chance against Law. I recommend that all Aislings deposit their valuables at your local bank. It is likely that you will visit Sgrios many times during this battle. King Bruce has offered the services of his Louresian Knights. They will hold the frontline.
       Below are words of inspiration from some of the Mundanes of Temuair. They wished me to pass it along to you all.

((You can download the Battle Hymn for this event on the Dark Ages website in the Download section u�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������nder Music. The file is 34.zip. Unzip this file in the music folder in your Dark Ages directory. The event will begin this Friday evening, the 28th))

From the Mundanes:

"My Dear Aislings,
Never before will so many owe so much to so few.  You who go forth to battle the Dark Aislings and that horrific thrice-be-damned, Law, go forth with the hopes and fears of all Temuair.  You are, each and every one of you, a hero.  I commend you all and send you the blessings of all the gods.

Be Brave
Be Strong
Be... Victorious"

(His Majesty, King Bruce at the commissioning of the First Volunteer Corps of Loures)


"Oh My, I just cannot believe that it has come to this.  War... horrific, bloody war. Please be safe, all of you.  Know that you go forth into this great endeavor with our blessings, hopes, and above all love.  Come back to us, all of you.  Defeat the Dark Forces that threaten our way of life!"

Riona, Mileth Innkeeper.


"The God of War has blessed you.  You are all fortunate to be able to take part in this greatest of all Battles.  May the fields run crimson with the life-flow of our enemies.  Crush them beneath your feet.  Befuddle them with your spells!  Slice them and grind them up to make the flour for the bread of the War God!! Oh the glory of righteous battle.  The purity of purpose!  Go ye forth and destroy our enemies in the holy flame of Our Anger!"

Erika, Temple Acolyte ~ Ceannlaidir


"I usually stay out of these things, but enough is enough, they took out Cedric.  Go kick their behinds!"

Nigel, Tagor


"There is Dark Magic and then again, there is DARK Magic.  The magic of Law and the Dark Aislings leave no room for the Spark that makes even a Necromancer a child of the Gods.  Should Law and his minions win the war, we will be plunged into a time of chaos and despair that would make even Sgrios, himself, weep.  The very ground we tread upon will scream in pain and the clouds will rain blood and carnage upon all the lands.  Carry the day, oh Aislings.  Carry the Day!"

Matei the Wizard, Tagor
