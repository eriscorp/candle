  <Content>The next contest will be held shortly. We are currently making changes to the contest system. The new system will be more player involved.

As some of you may already know we are working on a new area to be added for Dark Ages. This will involve new items, quests, clothes, and maps. We will inform of the release date soon. Thank you for your support.
