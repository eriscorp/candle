  <Content>Greetings Ladies and Gents,

The air has turned crisp and cool and the leaves are fading from lush green to rich gold and blushing scarlet 'ere the crops wither and the world fades beneath shroud of pale snow. The ghouls, the goblins, and vile things of all types relish the change of the season for a chance at prolonging the frozen blight of winter.

Rejoice for we do not worry about them! Our sparks within us are strong enough to muster through the harshest of winters ahead, so we at the Suomi Troupe wish for you to join us for a few themed festivities for all to enjoy before the nights grow long and shadow�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������s dark.

Face your Fears: Hallows Eve themed stories will be told which require you and your fellow Aislings to slay the demons dreamed up by Suomi Troupe members. These stories are in brackets for scaled difficulty so all may enjoy at least one tale.

Treacherous Tides: A murder mystery of treason upon the seas. The pirate captain has been slain aboard his own ship! None of the crew have left the ship, so it is up to you to solve the puzzle. Speak with the crew members to determine which swashbuckler is actually a bilge rat.

Trick or Treat: Tour the inns of Temuair to trick or treat. Suomi Troupe members will be stationed around the continent's inns in order to give riddles and/or gifts to players who are interested in partaking in the light hearted tradition.

We hope to see you there~
