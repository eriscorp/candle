  <Title>Dark Ages Down Time 10/28-10/30</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>We apologize for the unexpected down-time that occurred between 10/28 and 10/30. The problem has been resolved and Dark Ages is now up and running. The Halloween Events will be extended to November 6th. We will be adding 2 extra days to all accounts that were registered during that time. All auto-renewal accounts will receive an in-game bonus. If your account was on auto-renewal during the downtime, you will receive 5 million gold and a choice of one of the following pets. These pets will be exclusive to this auto-renewal compensation. Please submit a ticket to Dark Ages Support specifying which character����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� will receive this compensation.

Auto-renewal pets:
Succubus
Green Dragon (single-head)
Horse

If your account was registered during this down-time and you did not receive the extra 2 days, please submit a ticket to Dark Ages support.

Accounts on auto-renewal are receiving the in-game compensation because they do not benefit from the extra day bonus.

The distribution of the gold and pets will take few days and possibly a week. Sending multiple tickets will only delay your request (tickets are merged and then sent down the list as a recent ticket.)</Content>
