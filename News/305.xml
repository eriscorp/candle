  <Title>The Order of Danaan Meets Again</Title>
  <Type>1</Type>
  <Content>There again stands a man possessing the Ca√≠ dh
Leabhar.  He ventures to Suomi, home of Deoch, God of
Light.  Standing in the area claimed before for
Danaan, his Mass begins.

The Order of Danaan reconvenes to bring worship and
glory to the Lightbringer Danaan.  A call goes out to
summon the faithful to the fields of Suomi.

((The Order of Danaan will meet July 16, at 7:00 PM
PST.  As with previous Masses, there is NO experience
or legend marks to be gained from attendance, and it
is purely a roleplay activity.))
