  <Content>Suffering from boredom, King Bruce has requested a fireworks show from one of the court jesters. Francis, the fireworks jester, will appear in front of Loures Castle and perform a fireworks show once every Temuairian day (every 3 hours). Francis will also be selling fireworks (for in-game gold).

((This event will begin on July 3rd and will end on July 9th.)) </Content>
