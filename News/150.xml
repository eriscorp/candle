  <Content>Just in time to cool off during the dog days of summer, Dark Ages has opened Lynith Beach to all Dark Ages players today. Hot off the expansion of Oren Island in May, this new tropical paradise has been opened up for play.

In this expansion, a new underwater world, a pirate ship, the Oren Sewers, and a tropical beach have opened up for players to explore. Along with these new areas are new monsters, new clothing for players to wear, new items, and a new jewelry shop open for business.
