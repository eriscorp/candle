  <Content>Hello Aislings!

I want to take a moment to thank each and every one of you who came around to the love games events. I suppose Erika would also like to thank those who went to the war-inspired games which were so suddenly planned and held during the little event we Gliocans had sorted out with the Suomi Troupe. Honestly, if you asked me, I don't think that was a coincidence.

Nevertheless, I sincerely hope that everyone had an absolutely fantastic time, and (to further congratulate the winners) I made a little list of the winners!

Congratulations goes out to:
* Style who aided the munda�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������nes the most in Passion for Compassion
* Meikie, Sai, Daedric, and Hite who all won during the Hide and Seek game
* PiNKLiLY who simply trampled the competition in the Jousting exhibition
* Bee, NeoxBahamut, DuenanKnute, and Torbjorn who stood out in the Fashion Show
* Sai, Meike, and Zells who were the last ones standing in the Grappling ring
* and DefiniteLee who shared the sweetest words during the Poetry Contest.

Love,
Maeveen
