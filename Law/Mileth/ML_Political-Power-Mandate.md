# Political Power Mandate

The Political Power Mandate is the primary set of procedures for all Mileth officials. Its guidelines overrule all other laws with the exception of the Mileth Town Charter.

## I. Investigations

All investigations must be posted on the Justice Cases board. Reports for punitive actions may take the place of this post for judicial investigations provided all of the details of the investigation are included in the report. No official may interfere with or interrupt another official's investigation (or review) until it has been closed unless one of the following applies:

- \1) The investigation has been open for longer than permissable by this mandate
- \2) The investigating official requests assistance
- \3) The investigating official is no longer in office
- \4) A superior has probable cause to believe the investigating official is abusing his/her powers.

- A. Judicial Investigations
  - A judicial investigation is the process of collecting testimony and/or evidence of an incident until there is sufficient evidence to justify legal action. Judicial investigations apply to criminal activity and may be held by any judicial official of Mileth.
  - Any judicial official may investigate any other official, regardless of status or superiority, who is suspected of criminal activity.
- B. Board Abuse/Misuse Investigations
  - Board abuse/misuse investigations must be held by one of the officials responsible for monitoring the board as laid out by law. If a post is in violation of law, it must be removed and replaced with an announcement of the burning of the post, including its title, author, and reason for burning. A copy of the offending post, through memories, must be kept for a minimum of one deoch after the post is deleted.
  - Should judicial action be necessary, any legislative official who handles a board abuse/misuse investigation must forward evidence to a judicial official, who must conduct any judicial investigations.
- C. Reviews
  - An official may review a case if one of the following applies:
    - \1) There is probable cause to believe an error may have been made
    - \2) The subject requests a review of his/her case
    - \3) The investigating official does not have the authority to order the full punishment
    - \4) Review is required by this mandate
  - Reviews may be held by any official who can establish superiority as defined in this mandate. When a review is opened, the official being reviewed has one moon to send the reviewing official all applicable evidence. Following the receipt of evidence (or failure to send evidence within one moon), the reviewing official has a maximum of one moon to complete the review. Original charges will be upheld should the reviewing official fail to close the review within these time constraints.
  - A review must come to one of the following conclusions:
    - \1) The evidence provided by the original investigating official was sufficient and no action is to be taken.
    - \2) The evidence provided by the original investigating official was insufficient and the actions are to be overruled. Actions may or may not be taken against the original investigating official, depending on the situation, within the constraints of Mileth law.
- D. Misconduct Investigations
  - Officials may open an investigation on an official, whom they can establish superiority on per this mandate, for misconduct given probable cause to believe misconduct has been committed by the suspected official. When an investigation is opened, the official being investigated has one moon to send the investigating official all applicable evidence. Following the receipt of evidence (or failure to send evidence within one moon), the investigating official has a maximum of one moon to complete the investigation.
  - Misconduct investigations must come to one of the following conclusions:
    - \1) Evidence proves misconduct and the subject official is to be punished according to law.
    - \2) Evidence is insufficient to prove misconduct and the investigation is to be closed with no action to be taken.

## II. Establishing Rank

This chart outlines the rank of each office:

```text
Rank| Judicial Branch | Legislative Branch
----|-----------------|-------------------
6.0 |  Judge          |  Burgess
3.0 |  Guard Captain  |  Demagogue
1.5 |  Guard          |
0.0 |        Respected Citizen
____|_________________|___________________
```

## III. Establishing Superiority

Officials within the same branch who work together may combine their ranks to establish a higher rank by adding their individual ranks together numerically. This may be used whenever a higher rank is necessary to fulfill an action defined by law except to establish superiority over guards (unless no captain or judge is in office).

To establish superiority over another official as an individual, one must be of the same branch of office, and one's rank must be a numerically higher value than that official. If officials combine ranks, the combined rank must be higher by at least two.

Once superiority has been established, officials may conduct investigations or review cases handled by their subordinates as outlined in this mandate. They may also issue punishments for errors or misconducts as necessary by law. They must be able to produce factual evidence to overrule an original order; a final report must be filed with an explanation of the reason for overruling, and evidence must be made available to the individual being overruled upon request.

An official who has been involved in a case via investigation or review may not investigate or review the same case again as a superior in any way.

## IV. Power Limitations of Ranks

- A. Guard (1.5)
  - Guard is the most basic rank of office for law enforcement and the easiest judicial office to obtain. They are limited to the second level of punishment, banishment. They may not order any exiles, barments or sgath summonings.
- B. Guard Captain (3)
  - Guard captain is one rank above guards. They are limited to the fourth level of punishment. They may not order exiles of more than eight moons. They may not order barments or sgath summonings.
- C. Judge (6)
  - Judges are the highest ranking judicial office. They may order any exile, barment or sgath summoning as permitted by law. The only exception to this is the barment of legislative officials - this may only be done by the burgess rank.
- D. Demagogue (3)
  - Demagogue is the lowest ranking legislative official. They are simply to carry out exiles and pardons as ordered by judicials. They may not order any penalties or criminal punishments.
- E. Burgess (6)
  - Burgess is the highest ranking legislative official. The only penalty a burgess may order is a barment on a legislative official as permitted by law. A burgess may enact any legal barment on any aisling, but may not order barments on any non-legislative branch of office or non-official. A burgess may not order any other penalties or criminal punishments.

## V. Punishment

The actions defined in section ["A) Actions"] may be ordered and executed in accordance with Mileth law, following the requirements defined by this mandate.

Mileth law defines what activities result in which actions. However, in a case where a malicious activity is undefined or without a defined consequence, a judge may determine the appropriate action to be taken.

All actions (as so listed) and official investigations or reviews require a report. The proper format for these reports is defined in the Judicial and Legislative Directives.

Any reports made must also be forwarded to the subject(s) punished.

- _NOTE: No official is to be punished for failing to send a report if it cannot be proven beyond doubt they did not send a report._

### Applying Penalties Defined in Part A

A crime is "active" starting on the date the crime occurs. The crime will remain active for two moons or until the aisling is charged with that crime. When an aisling is punished for the crime committed, it will remain active for 1 moon. Warranted crimes, including exile warrants, will remain active as long as they exist. If an aisling is exiled, the crime will remain active until they are due for pardon. Aislings cannot be punished for crimes that are not active.

Board abuse/misuse remains an active crime while the post remains on the board; it becomes inactive one moon after its deletion.
When an aisling is charged with multiple active crimes, the punishment depends on the number of active crimes committed and the highest initial punishment. The active crime that merits the highest level of punishment will be the starting point. For every additional active crime the punishment is increased by one level.

- _NOTE: Levels of Punishment are listed below._

Currently exiled aislings who commit any additional crimes shall still follow the above rules. Active crimes are to be reevaluated using the above rules and the length of exile must be adjusted accordingly.

| Levels of Punishment   |
| ---------------------- |
| 1 - Warning            |
| 2 - Banishment \*      |
| 3 - 4 Moon Exile       |
| 4 - 8 Moon Exile       |
| 5 - 1 Deoch Exile      |
| 6 - 16 Moon Exile      |
| 7 - 20 Moon Exile      |
| 8 - 2 Deoch Exile \*\* |

\*\* In instances where multiple crimes with an initial punishment of 2 Deochs are committed, the punishments will stack. Otherwise, punishment shall never exceed 2 Deochs under any circumstances.  
\*\ For crimes with an initial punishment listed as "Based on Severity", the investigating official will determine the appropriate punishment level for the crime. The punishment may not exceed the Second Level of Punishment for a single charge. Until punished for any crimes committed, any additional "Based on Severity" crimes will not be stacked.

- A judge may determine his/her own punishment on a case by case basis as long as it does not exceed the punishment defined in the Criminal Code for the crime(s) involved.

#### A) Actions

- \1. Removing Citizenship Legends
  - This may be used at the request of a legal citizen.

##### i) Criminal Penalties

- \1. Warning
  - A warning is an official notice to an aisling that they have committed a minor crime, informing them further action will follow should they continue. Warnings may be given verbally or through mail with proof of issuance as well as proof, in the case of a verbal warning, that the warned aisling is present when warned.
- \2. Banishment
  - Banishments may be forgiven if the banishment was found unlawful by the banishing official or his/her superior.
  - Banishment accompanies all exile orders.
- \3. Exile
  - Exile lengths may not exceed two deochs unless the initial punishment for multiple charges includes a two deoch exile.
  - Exiles are executed and pardoned by legislative officials as ordered by judicial officials.
  - Pardons may be ordered by the official who ordered the exile or that official's superior if the exile is found to be unlawful after review. Pardons may be ordered by a judge if the exile is over two deochs old and unlisted. If records are lost earlier than two deochs from the aisling's exile, a judge may investigate and determine the pardon date based on the crime and dates, or order their pardon should no evidence be found.
  - Legislative officials are not accountable for the legality of exile or pardon orders, but may request evidence of a case prior to executing an order.
  - A legislative official may request banishment on an aisling who has too much clout to be exiled. Proof that they have too much clout must be provided.
- \4. Barment
  - Orders to bar are to be posted on the judgment board by the appropriate rank of office. During the time of barment, the effected aisling may not take any office. Barments will go into effect immediately following the order unless it accompanies another punitive action, in which case the barment will automatically begin on the expiration date of said actions. Aliran does not need to be called for the barment to be considered active.
- \5. Sgath Summonings
  - An aisling may be summoned into the sgath pit by a judge or a burgess once the sgath summoning has been ordered. Any judicial or legislative official may summon the shadow hunger on the condemned after the aisling has been summoned.

##### ii) Official Discipline

This is a list of the types of discipline that can be issued by an official's superior. The purpose of this page is to explain the length and requirements for each discipline. Other laws point to these types of discipline for specific situations and activites.

- \1. Demerit
  - Demerits are notices of errors made by an official, issued by his/her superior in accordance with Mileth law. There are two levels of demerits: Minor Demerit and Major Demerit. Demerits expire upon ending the term they were received in.
  - A major demerit is to be given if an official receives a probation and the reason should be: "Probation."
- \2. Probation
  - Probation may be issued to an official by his/her superior for severe misconduct according to Mileth law.
  - Probations will remain in effect for an aisling until they have completed a new term in the same branch of office (defined in judicial and legislative directives) he/she was in when receiving the probation. Probations expire after four deochs.
  - A major demerit accompanies all probations issued.
- \3. Removal from Office
  - Any official may use this ability with a legal removal order. Any other use is considered abuse of power.
  - A legal removal order is one issued by a superior as a result of five minor demerits (or equivalent), two simultaneously active probations, or an infraction in which Mileth law states the consequence is removal from office.
  - If an official is warranted for removal from office less than eight suns prior to the completion of that term, and the official does complete that term, the official is to receive a probation that will remain in effect until he/she completes a new term in the same branch of office he/she was in when receiving the removal warrant. If the removal is fulfilled, however, the probation will not be issued.
  - Removal from office automatically accompanies barment orders and banishment or exile warrants.

## VI. Fair Political Practices

- A. Rights
  - It is the right of each Mileth Official to use their political power in order to support, endow, attack and widdle another official of Mileth, and this without having to provide a reason.
  - This right is lifted when it concerns officials who are already opposed in a Judiciary case and political dispute. A superior who is not involved in the case must settle the dispute before the right to widdle is restored.
  - Political actions are NOT harassment.
- B. Use of Demotion
  - The Use of Demotion is limited to officials who are carrying out a legal removal order, in order to facilitate the removal of an individual's clout. Demotion may also be executed on officials who violate this mandate, the Mileth Town Charter or any other core law once per violation.
  - The use of demote in any other way is considered illegal, and will be considered an abuse of power and a violation of this Mandate.
  - Note: Judges and Burgesses cannot be demoted.
- C. Dismissing Sponsored Officials
  - This action may be carried out on aislings who are warranted to be removed from office. Officials with a valid reason as the sponsor of the aisling may Dismiss a sponsored official. This action removes clout.
- D. Removals
  - Office holders may remove other office holders only in carrying out a legal warrant for their removal. All other removals are deemed in violation of the mandate, and an Abuse of Power. (See also: Mundane Notices: Mileth Office Holders on Duty).
  - An official who believes their removal order is unjust may request a review, as previously defined in this law.
- E. Appeals
  - Any official being charged with removal from office or exile has the right to request an appeal to review the evidence of the case for a second and final time within two moons of the first review.
    - \1) By requesting an appeal, the official charged with removal or exile waives any right to a trial, should the punishment merit a trial.
    - \2) Appeals may be carried out by officials of equal or superior rank to the official who had placed the order for punishment.
    - \3) All orders for actions against the official accused of misconduct must be placed on hold by the final reviewer until the appeal has been concluded.
- F. Crimes Against Mileth Officials
  - To eliminate the perception of bias, any Mileth Official that is the victim of any crime must call in a separate judicial official to the scene to handle the case. The only exception to this would be profanity directed at the official.
