# Mileth Town Charter

Criminal Marks: Any mark given by any official as a result of criminal activity.

## I. Citizenship

All citizens and visitors of Mileth have the right to be protected from harm of any nature as defined by Mileth Law.

For citizenship to be granted, aislings must meet the following eligibility criteria:

Possess

- Three or fewer criminal marks
- Zero criminal marks less than one deoch old
- Zero Sgath scars

Ineligible citizens are to be banished from Mileth to remove citizenship. Admitting a citizen who is ineligible is to be considered a violation of this charter.

Should the date of any criminal marks come into question, the mundanes are to be contacted for date verification.

## II. Eligibility for office

Aislings with more than two criminal marks are permanently ineligible to assume any office. Aislings with one or two criminal marks must adhere to the following waiting periods in order to be considered eligible for office.

| Office    | 1 Criminal Mark | 2 Criminal Marks |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| R.C.      | 2 Deochs        | 3 Deochs         |
| Guard     | 4 Deochs        | 8 Deochs         |
| Captain   | 6 Deochs        | 13 Deochs        |
| Judge     | 12 Deochs       | 20 Deochs        |
| Demagogue | 6 Deochs        | 13 Deochs        |
| Burgess   | 15 Deochs       | Never            |

It is a violation of this law to sponsor any citizen who is ineligible for office.

## III. Criminal Charges

Any aisling under Mileth's jurisdiction who commits a crime is to be charged to the full extent of all applicable laws while the crime is active. See 'Criminal Code' for details regarding the behavior of active crimes.
Mileth officials who commit a crime are to be issued a probation. Should the crime merit punishment beyond warning, s/he is ineligible to complete his/her term.

Should an aisling holding office in Rucesion commit a crime in Mileth's jurisdiction, a guard captain or judge must notify a Rucesion guard captain or judge.

## IV. Evidence

Officials must keep evidence for all of their cases for at least one deoch after the crime becomes inactive.

There are three forms of valid evidence: memories, journals and ((videos)).

((Screenshots created by pressing f12 are the only form of "memories" acceptable as valid evidence. Screenshots are saved in your Dark Ages folder. Files must be unaltered.))  
((Videos)) and journals are only admissible with sufficient memories to support them.  
Evidence must prove criminal activity and jurisdiction for a valid case.

## V. Required Laws

Mileth at all times must maintain a law or laws which govern the use of political powers of office holders. Removal of such a law or laws without a replacement would be considered void.

## VI. Prohibited Laws

No laws may be passed which:

- A) Limit or restrict the lawful discharge of political powers while an aisling is in office legally
- B) Permit the exile of aislings for periods exceeding two deochs for a single charge as per the mundane mandate. Exiles may only exceed two deochs if there are multiple charges of crimes for which the initial punishment is a two deoch exile.
- C) Permit aislings to be punished for violating a law which was not in force at the time of the violation.
- D) Violate the rights of citizens and/or guests.

## VII. Law Structure

Mileth Town Charter is the backbone of Mileth law and thus supersedes all other laws and requires 100% support to revise or remove over a minimum voting period of three moons.

The core laws (listed below) are also vital to the structure of Mileth's laws. These laws supersede all other laws (except this charter) and require 75% support to revise over a minimum voting period of two moons. Removal of these laws require 100% approval during a minimum voting period of three moons.

Right of burgess is not permitted for use on this or any core law.

### Core Laws

- Martial Law Act
