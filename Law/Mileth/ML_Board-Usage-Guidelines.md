## II. Punishment

### A. Board Misuse

Should a board be used in a manner that is not laid out by law, the poster shall be guilty of Board Misuse (save in cases where the poster is charged with Board Abuse for that post) and the offending post shall be removed.

Posts containing inappropriately hostile messages may be removed and the offender found guilty of Board Misuse. A hostile post is defined as a post which uses insults and personal attacks in a manner that does not reflect the nature of constructive discourse.

Posts containing inappropriate, but still legal content may be removed with the support of another official. The author shall be charged with Board Misuse.

Crimes need to be reported to the appropriate official; boards are not to be used as a means for reporting crimes, and offending posts will be removed and the offender found guilty of Board Misuse.

### â€‹B. BOARD ABUSE

An aisling who uses a post as a medium to commit criminal activity as outlined under the law shall be guilty of Board Abuse, and the offending post shall be removed. An aisling who posts on an Official Board without holding office shall be guilty of Board Abuse. The investigating official shall excuse incidents where this has been done by accident ((or if the offending aisling was posting spacer posts to assist an official)). An aisling guilty of board abuse will be charged as defined by the Criminal Code.
