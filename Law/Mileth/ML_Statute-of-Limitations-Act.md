  - \*\* Exiles Due for Pardon may be removed from the records after they have been due for 3 Deochs. The exiled must provide sufficient proof to a Judge to show that their exile is due after their record has been removed.
- B. Early Pardons from Exiles or Barments
  - Should an aisling be pardoned from their exile or barment before their time is served they shall have their exile and/or barment reinstated for the remainder of the time unserved, by order of a Judge.
  - A Judge may also investigate the aisling whose exile and/or barment was pardoned early. Should the judge find that the aisling knew they were being unjustly pardoned early, they may order a 1 Deoch extension to the aisling's exile and/or barment (whichever is applicable) in addition to the time unserved.
