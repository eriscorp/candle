## Definition of Theft

Theft is defined as the unlawful and unauthorized deprivation of an item to which another aisling has rightful ownership.  

An aisling should, before doing anything else, request that the individual, who they believe stole from them, return the item.  

For the purposes of this law, the term 'item' can refer to services, gold, or a physical object.  

In order for the theft fall under Mileth Jurisdiction, both ends of the agreement must be worldly objects.  

## Definition of Ownership

- \1. An item received from a mundane that has dropped on the floor underneath an Aisling because they were overweight.  This item(s) - such as political garbs, quest rewards, and mastering equipment - belongs to the Aisling it was originally intended.
  - Note: In the event that the item may not physically be returned, punishment shall be Based on Severity. The theft must be reported to a Knight so that the mundanes may be informed and the items returned to their proper owner.
- \2. An item that is in use as a decoration is owned by the aisling who dropped it.
- \3. An item dropped from a monster is owned by the aisling or hunting group that killed the monster. Summoned monsters are exempt from this (see part 4).
- \4. An item dropped by a summoned monster - such as a creant - is owned by the Aisling who summoned the monster.
- \5. An Aisling is considered to be the owner of an item should they fulfill their part of a verbal (or written) agreement.
  - Note: Only the Aisling who made the agreement is responsible for producing the item. ((All agreements involving the exchanging of goods must be made entirely through an exchange window; exchanges of goods that require any other method of item delivery is invalid.))
  - \1. An Aisling retains ownership of an item even when 'loaning' an item to another Aisling.
  - \2. An Aisling's death pile remains their property until its curse expires.
    - Note: The right to this death pile remains with the deceased even after the curse has been lifted if the cause of their death is linked to murder.
  - \3. Gems and prayer necklaces belong to the Aisling who dropped them, so long it is underneath their feet.
    - Note: Theft of a prayer necklace is considered petty.

## Classifications and Punishments

Theft is divided into two separate types, depending on the estimated market value of the item in question.  

If, and only if, after a Mileth Law Enforcer has requested that an item be returned, and the item has been returned, then the charges will be much less severe (as listed in the Criminal Code).  

The punishments, as listed in the Criminal Code, do NOT apply if the rightful owner of the item requests that it be returned, and it is.  

Punishment for any theft may be stacked with murder, even when exceeding two deochs.
