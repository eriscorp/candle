# Martial Law Act

During times of crisis, martial law may be declared by a majority of Mileth officials in Temuair at the time of the crisis provided one of them is a demagogue or burgess and another a captain or a judge. Once approved, martial law is immediately in effect and a demagogue or burgess shall post it on all the boards within Mileth's jurisdiction.

- A. Declaration
  - \1) It is required of the legislative branch to inform the other members of the legislature who are not present, that martial law has been declared. Legislative officials must post a message on all of the Mileth boards that martial Law is in effect, and a demagogue or burgess removes the notices when Martial Law is no longer in effect.
  - \2) It is required of all captains to inform their guards that martial law has been declared and that guards are to enforce and regulate Mileth law and martial law as accorded.
  - \3) For the first eight days ((24 hours)) of martial law, it is required to have guard(s) placed at the inn and at Mileth Village Way to announce that martial law is in effect, and that aislings entering Mileth must refer to  the law. Other officials may also do this should there be a shortage of guards.
  - \4) All aislings will be held accountable for their actions and can be dealt with according to the terms of martial law, whether they state that they knew martial law was in effect or not.
- B. Punishment During Martial Law
  - Instant banishment shall result in all those inciting to riot, aiding the current crisis, or hindering the efforts of officials. Guards will not be required to immediately make a formal report on any banishments resulting from martial law. Before they retire they should post a record of banishments and brief descriptions of each.
- C. Temporary Laws
  - Mileth demagogues and burgesses may enact temporary laws relating to the crisis at hand. The waiting period is waved and the temporary laws may be passed by a majority vote in favor of the law. These laws should be posted on the law board and on all other Mileth boards.
- D. Ending Martial Law
  - Martial law will be ended with a majority vote of officials in Temuair at the time of voting or if the crisis that triggered martial law has ended. The declaration of martial law and any laws going with it will be removed from all boards.
