# Official Instruction Mandate

The purpose of this mandate is to ensure the proper instruction of officials upon the entrance into office for the first time.

## I. Requirements for eligibility

Those entering their first term of guard, guard captain or demagogue are required to undergo training from the proper officials to be considered eligible for office. Those who have taken office without beginning their training are ineligible for office until they have fulfilled requirements for eligibility through an exam under the terms in [Section III] and [Section V]. Guard captains and judges may conduct guard training. Judges may conduct captain training. A burgess may conduct demagogue training.
Should the proper official not be in office, a senior guard may conduct guard training, a senior captain may conduct captain training or a senior demagogue may conduct demagogue training.

## II. Training Procedures

Training should instruct an aisling in the knowledge and protocols needed in fulfilling the duties given to the office they are seeking. Captain training should also prepare an aisling for future judge terms as their duties work similarly and it is a good time for an aisling to learn how the whole system works. Trainers should work closely with the trainee in instructing them in, at minimum, the areas listed below. This should be done both in theory and, whenever possible, in practice. Of course, if the trainee is not in office, the trainer should be the one conducting any actual investigations and handling the situation, but they can walk the trainee through the steps and have them observe the procedure.
Training should prepare the trainee for an exam which will complete the training once successfully passed by the trainee. The exam should be a comprehensive test of their learnings in every area covered in the training curriculum in [Section IV] (The list is a minimum; tests and training must include these items but are not limited to these items alone). The training should entirely prepare the trainee for this exam.

## III. Exams

A trainee can request the exam at any point during training. Once an exam is passed, the training may be considered legally complete and the trainee will be considered eligible for the office trained for. The trainer or trainee may choose to continue training beyond the exam if mutually desired, but this will have no impact on the trainee's eligibility for office once the exam is passed.

- A. There is no limit to the number of attempts a trainee may take to pass the exam.
- B. An exam must be passed either prior to taking office or within two moons after the start of their first term for the first term guard or guard captain to be considered eligible for office.
- C. If an exam is requested prior to the completion of their curriculum, they forfeit their rights given in [Section VI].

## â€‹V. Ineligibility

Those who are entering their first term of guard or guard captain are ineligible for office if they have not completed the proper training as defined by this mandate.
Those who have entered their first term of guard or guard captain office without completing their training have two moons after the start of their term to complete their training with the required exam. Should they fail to pass the exam in this time period, they will be ineligible to complete the remainder of their term. They will remain ineligible for office until they have successfully passed the exam.
Those who have not been in any office for at least eight deochs must pass an exam to be considered eligible for office again.

If no eligible trainers are available for two moons (and still aren't available), an aisling can be considered eligible for office. Should an eligible trainer enter office later in this situation, they may require training and/or an exam, making the aisling ineligible for office should they refuse or fail.

An aisling may not request or perform training or examination from a known sibling of theirs. Any training or exams performed amongst family will be nulled. The trainee will be considered ineligible for office and both aislings will be dealt with accordingly.

An aisling who is ineligible for office or ineligible to complete their term is considered an "Illegal Official" as defined by the Official Misconduct Act.

## VI. Quality Assurance

As part of providing a fair experience for all new and rising officials, it is important to ensure that the trainers are providing sufficient information for trainees to succeed.

Trainers must record a journal of all training sessions.

If a trainee who completes the trainer's curriculum then fails their exam, the trainee may request a quality assurance [QA] check; they must prove with memories that they were an accepted trainee of the accused trainer and failed their exam. This QA check will be done by a third party official(s) who holds at minimum the same rank within the same branch as the original trainer.

The QA check official will review evidence from the trainer to see that either a minimum of 70% of the required curriculum for training was covered in the training sessions, or that the trainee requested an exam prior to completion of the curriculum.

If either of these outcomes are proven, the trainer will pass the QA check. If neither outcome is proven, the trainer will fail the QA check, be punished according to the Official Misconduct Act, and the trainee will be referred to a new trainee, with their time to complete their training extended by two moons from the conclusion of the QA check.
