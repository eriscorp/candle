# Murder Law

All citizens and visitors of Mileth, regardless of gender, path, citizenship, or legal status, have the right to life, a right guaranteed by the Charter. Murder is defined as the unlawful deprivation of another Aisling's life.  

For the purposes of this law, death is defined as the physical death of an Aisling, which causes their body to become a spirit. Death can be proven via a memory of the aisling's loss of 50 vitality ((announcement message upon death)).  

- MURDER
  - Murder is defined as deprivation of another aisling's life. In Murder cases, death must occur for it to be Murder.
- ATTEMPTED MURDER
  - Attempted Murder is the result of failing to cause an aisling's death defined in Murder.
- RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT
  - The act of using a skill or spell on any creature that would give it increased power over an Aisling and/or using a skill or spell on any Aisling that would weaken them when in contest with a creature and failing to correct this error and/or saving the Aisling's life.
  - This includes Grouphunting. In the event that a skill or spell was used that cannot be corrected, the Aisling who used the skill or spell shall ensure any applicable Aisling's safety until the effects of the skill or spell wear off; failure to do so will result in a murder charge instead of what would have been a reckless endangerment charge.

## EXEMPTIONS

There are a few instances in which under no circumstance, can a murder charge of any sort, be brought against an Aisling. These are very few, and very specific.  

- a) Willful Harm: "To a willing person, no injury is done." Someone who willingly places their life in danger cannot claim they were murdered, under any circumstance. Entering the Arena is a prime example of this. This does not include entering monster hunting areas. Any form of Murder threat is excluded from this.
- b) Death by Inaction: An aisling who dies by a creature, or creatures, because someone did not protect them or use an item to cast beothaich deur, cannot charge those who failed to act with murder. The exception to this is if another aisling casts a spell or skill that causes or increases harm done to the aisling.
- c) Sgath Summoning: Death which is caused by a legally sanctioned Sgath summoning is not considered murder, as it is a death which is legally allowed by Mileth Law. However, illegal/unauthorized Sgath summonings will be dealt with according to the 'Official Misconduct Act'.
- d) Masking Aislings: Killing a masked aisling is not murder. Attacking a masked aisling that results in the attacker's death is not the masked aisling's fault.
