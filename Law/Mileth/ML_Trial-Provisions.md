## TRIAL RIGHTS

### Right to Request a Trial

- An Aisling committing a crime or series of crimes which merit barment, sgath, and/or an eight moon exile or greater has the right to request to have a trial.
- Making this request does not guarantee the Aisling a trial. (see 'Disqualification of Trial Rights')
- Additionally, officials who are facing removal from office AND banishment and/or exile, for political misconduct, may request a trial in lieu of having a review by a superior. In so doing, they automatically forfeit their right to request a review by a superior.
- The trial request must be made to a Judge within one moon from the time charges were filed, otherwise trial rights are forfeited by default.
- If there is no Judge in office, the request can be made with a Guard Captain, however, only a Judge may proceed with a trial.

### Disqualification of Trial Rights
  
- An official who is facing removal and banishment and/or exile for political misconduct, who has already had an appeal by a superior for that same crime, is not entitled to a trial.
- Sleephunting charges are not eligible for trial. If an aisling would meet the required criteria without the sleephunting charges included, the aisling may request a trial.
- Should any aisling's name, portrait, or profile violate Mundane or Mileth law, they are not fit to receive a trial.
- A judge may deny a trial to an aisling if they have the support of one guard captain or one burgess, and both have posted reasonable explanations as to why the aisling should be denied trial on the Judgment board. If a trial is denied for this reason, no other judge may preside over the same trial unless they have the support of one guard captain or one burgess, and all have posted explanations as to why the denial of trial rights was unjust on the Judgments board.

### Trial Date Selection

- The defense must meet with the judge and prosecution to schedule a date for the trial. The defense is to name a date and time within two moons of the trial request, but no sooner than eight days from the date of the request, that is agreeable with both the judge and the Prosecution.
- Should the defense be unable to provide a date and time that is acceptable to all parties, they must accept a date as prescribed by a judge.

### Jury Selection

- The jury will be selected by the judge at the time of the Trial.
- A qualified juror is a Mileth citizen who is at least five deochs old and has mastered. The juror must have not been arrested or jailed within the last Deoch, nor may they have been arrested or jailed more than twice.
- A minimum of seven jurors are to be chosen, but no more than eleven. Each juror must not be connected to the prosecution, defense, or Judge in any way that may place them in a position of bias.
- Should the Judge be unable to find seven qualified jurors, or should a juror fall asleep during the trial so as to bring the number of jurors down below five without replacements on hand, the Judge must reschedule the trial.
- The defense and the prosecution may each deny jurors before the trial if they provide a valid reason to suspect that a juror is biased.

### Juror Procedures

- The Jury is to remained grouped with one other during the entire trial.
- They are also to elect a foreman.

- Along with the jury, two citizens will be found to record the proceedings in writing ((journal logs)). One will be grouped with the Jury and record the trial and their deliberations, and the second will be grouped with the Judge and record the trial.
- If there should be a lack of jurors, either citizen will fill in the empty spot. The recorded proceedings will be given to the presiding Judge when the trial is finished.
