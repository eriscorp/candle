# Criminal Code

This law lists and defines crimes and their initial penalties in Mileth.  
There are some Mileth laws which expand upon crimes listed in the Criminal Code. In the case of any discrepancy, these laws supersede the Criminal Code.

Judicial power limitations are defined in 'Political Power Mandate.'

A judge may declare a malicious act not defined by Mileth law a crime and determine a fair definition and penalty for this declared crime. The declaration shall be posted on the political discourse and community boards.

Stating that issues will be presented to higher authorities is within every aisling's rights and will not be considered a prohibited act.

Defining an activity as a criminal act when Mileth law states that such activities shall never be illegal is a procedural error and that official shall be given a major demerit.

## PROHIBITED CRIMINAL CONDUCT
