# Judicial Directive

This law describes the basic duties of all judicial officials. Judicial officials are guards, guard captains and judges.

## I. Conduct

Judicial officials must conduct themselves in an impartial manner. Their main goal is to settle conflict and resolve issues acceptable to all parties involved.

## II. Duties

### A. Knowledge

It is the job of judicial officials to remain up to date with Mileth Laws at all times. They must check for changes to the laws on a regular basis and stay involved with legislative officials.

### B. Active Duty

Judicial officials must serve their town by dedicating 40 hours per double-moon ((5 hours a week)) of their time to actively performing their duties as defined in this law. This must be time spent beyond fulfilling their passive duty defined below.

### C. Passive Duty

A judicial official is always on passive duty regardless of their situation. These are the conditions of office to serve one's town. They must respond to all complaints and situations where they are needed. If they cannot do this, they must find another official suitable for the situation.

### D. Investigations

- \1. Officials responding to aislings in need must follow these investigation guidelines
  Judicial officials handling investigations must collect evidence of the crime(s) being committed as well as any evidence from victims and witnesses. Suspects should be questioned without bias. Mediation amoung all parties is acceptable where possible. There are four main conclusions defined by this section as acceptable outcomes:
  - a) No investigation is necessary, because:
    - i) No crimes have been committed
    - ii) No jurisdiction can be established over the case
  - b) Insufficient evidence collected to establish guilt
  - c) Sufficient evidence has been collected by investigating official to recommend or warrant punishment
  - d) Mediation of the situation to an acceptable resolution decided by all parties
- \2. The investigating official(s) are to notify the involved parties of the determined solution of the investigation
- \3. Judicial officials should request a second reliable witness on difficult cases and situations.
- \4. To eliminate the perception of bias, should the victim be a judicial official they must request the aid of another judicial official to handle their case. This includes any siblings of the victimized judicial official.
  Officials may not be directly involved with investigation of cases pertaining to their siblings under any circumstance.

### E. Community Service

Judicial officials may also fulfill their active duty requirement by mentoring young Aislings in Mileth territory. All other active duties take priority over this one. Captains are responsible for instructing guards on how to perform this duty as part of their training duties in Section IV.

### F. Records of Office

It is the duty of all judicial officials to record any sponsorship or office taken on the Political Discourse Board. These records must include date, officials involved, actions performed, and the office and term to be taken.

Judicial officials are to wear their uniforms while conducting investigations or patrols within the limitations of the Jurisdiction Accords. Uniforms are also to be worn in meetings.

â€‹Uniforms are not to be worn outside Mileth's territories unless permitted by the Jurisdiction Accords.

Items that do not cover any piece of the uniform in any way, permanently or temporarily, are permissable while wearing the uniform on active duty.

((Animated effects are not to be worn while in uniform.))

## VIII. Meetings

Guards are to meet with guard captains at least once per double moon in the justice hall. The purpose of these meetings is to review laws and their applications discuss changes to laws and review specific cases or issues. Guard captains are responsible for hosting these meetings. Meetings shall occur regularly, every double moon, at a time specified by the senior captain in office. This time must be posted on the justice case board as defined in section III of this law. Any respecting citizen may attend. Attendance shall be taken by the host of the meeting and posted on the justice case board.

Should no guard captains be available during one of the meeting slots, a judge may opt to host the meeting. Otherwise, the senior guard present is to host the meeting. Judges are not required to attend or host any meeting.

Should a guard or guard captain be unable to attend either meeting, a superior guard captain or judge must be notified as soon as possible with the reason for the absence. Any unexcused absentees will be sent a letter by the hosting judicial notifying them that they missed a mandatory meeting and have one moon to reply with an excuse. Unexcused absences will not be tolerated.

## IX. PUNISHMENTS

Punishments are to be dealt out efficiently and fairly, and according to the individual laws or the current law of punishments.  
If an aisling is to be Sgathed, they must be informed by mail, and asked if they would like to have a trial. If the aisling declines, or no response is received within a reasonable amount of time ((48 hours)), the Sgathing may be carried out.  
If a trial verdict determines guilt sufficient for Sgathing, then the Sgath may be carried out.
