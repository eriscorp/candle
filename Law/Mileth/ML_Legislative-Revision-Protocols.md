# Legislative Revision Protocols

This law specifies the protocols for revising, adding and/or removing any laws of Mileth. The voting percentage and length of voting requirements specified for specific laws in the Mileth Town Charter override those requirements defined in this law.

Any legislative official may create a law proposal. Proposals must be made in accordance with these procedures.
When a proposal is ready to be opened for voting, it must be placed on the demagoguery board in the exact format and text in which it is to appear on the Mileth Law board. Spelling corrections which do not alter any meaning are permitted with the approval of another legislative official.

A post declaring the proposal "Open for Voting" must accompany the proposal. This post must go on the demagoguery board as well as the inbox of all legislative officials in office at the time of proposal. This post must include the following information:

- i) Changes, if any, to an existing law
- ii) Laws that it will replace (revision/replacement) or that will be removed (removal proposal)
- iii) Date at which the voting opens
- iv) Length and voting requirements as defined by this law

It is the duty of all legislative officials to vote on every proposal.

There are three ways to vote:

- Aye: You support the proposal.
- Nay: You do not support the proposal. A valid explanation must accompany "nay" votes.
- Abstain: You choose to remain neutral in the proposal. Note that legislatives must vote on all laws, so if they wish to remain neutral, they must vote abstain. Abstain votes do not calculate into the total votes cast.

Votes must be posted on the demagoguery board while the proposal is open and before it is closed to be considered valid.  
All proposals require a 2/3s majority vote to pass, unless otherwise written into a law being revised or taken out. Proposals must be open for no less than one moon and no greater than two moons. The official who opens a proposal may withdraw the proposal at any time before voting is closed.

Once the defined voting period has ended, the proposal must be declared "closed for voting" on the demagoguery board. This post must declare whether the proposal passes or fails, while following the regulations above.

## Right of Burgess

A burgess may close any proposal after fifteen suns have passed since the proposal was opened if all legislative officials in office during this time have voted "aye." If there are any "no" or "abstain" votes, or lack of an official's vote, this ability is void and the proposal must remain open for its original voting procedures.
