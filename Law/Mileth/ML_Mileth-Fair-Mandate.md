# Mileth Fair Mandate

Notes: The abilities to delegate and revoke the power to give all seals is dysfunctional. The ability to revoke fair rehearsal access is dysfunctional. Aislings can be sent to their home by revoking any seal (even if the aisling never had a seal); this tool may be used to remove aislings from the fair if they are misbehaving in accordance with this law.

## I. Fair Planning

Anyone interested in utilizing Mileth's fair grounds must do some planning ahead before it is opened to the public. It is advisable that the hosts have a solid understanding of the layout and functions of the grounds.

An aisling who wishes to become a fair marshall must submit a proposal to a burgess of Mileth with (A) the names and titles of those in his/her fair hosting committee, (B) a schedule of events and (C) a list of approved seal holders.

Once this proposal is accepted by a burgess, this document will become the Fair Agenda and is to be posted on public boards including the Community and Adventure Boards.

The approving burgess must post their approval of the proposed agenda on the Judgment Board, naming the FHC members and the dates and duration of the upcoming fair.

- A. Fair Hosting Committee (FHC)
  - A prospective fair marshall must form a fair hosting committee comprised of three or more members. The committee, here-on referred to as "FHC," is to lead operations during the fair. All members of the committee will be involved in the approval and disapproval of seals as well as the scheduling and monitoring of events within the grounds.
    - \1. Committee Structure
      - The FHC will be led by the fair marshall. The marshall will appoint an assistant fair marshall. Should any disputes arise between FHC members over any schedulings or the issuance or use of any seals, the marshall is to be consulted for the final say. In the marshall's absense, the assistant marshall is to be consulted. If both are absent, then the fair agenda is to be followed as written.
    - \2. Committee Powers
      - Both the marshall and the assistant marshall shall be granted marshall powers by the burgess. This power grants the ability to issue certain seals within the fair. The "Fair Marshall" legend mark is not to be confused with the titles within the FHC as specified in the fair agenda.
- B. Schedule of Events
  - A schedule of events must be made prior to the fair's opening in order to ensure sufficient utilization of the fair grounds. The schedule must include each event's title, date, time and the name of its host. The marshall may revise the schedule throughout the fair if approved by a burgess.
- C. Approved Seal Holders
  - A list of approved seal holders must be made. These are names of event hosts and other aislings that the FHC approves issuance of seals to. In the case of merchant seals, the marshall may decide, instead of listing individual names, to set a criteria of his/her choosing for those aislings that may be issued merchant seals.

## II. Seals

- A. Approval
  - All seals issued while the Mileth Fair Grounds are open to the public must be approved by the FHC.
    - \1. Merchant Seals
      - Merchant seals grant access to any of the merchant booths located in the Fair Market and around the perimeter of the Fair Events area. Merchant booths are typically used for sales and mini-games. Merchant seals must be approved by the FHC either as set by the fair agenda or on a case by case basis.
    - \2. Event Seals
      - Event seals grant access to the main event stage in the center of the Fair Events area. This stage is a multi-purpose area for planned events or games. Event hosts using this stage should be approved ahead of time on the fair agenda or on a case by case basis by the FHC.
    - \3. Theater Director Seals
      - Theater director seals grant access to the theater stage along with the ability to invite actors onstage and use visual or ceremonial effects. The theater is meant for stage entertainment and should be used for scheduled events only.
    - \4. Amphitheater Director Seals
      - Amphitheater director seals grant the ability to use visual and ceremonial effects as well as admit actors on stage. Note that there is no backstage access in the amphitheater, so the director may only put others onstage, not him/herself. Actors can also only leave stage by being helped out of the amphitheater by the mundane. The amphitheater is to be used for scheduled events that require a stage.
    - \5. Give Fair Rehearsal Access
      - This power grants access to the recipient while the fair is closed to the public. It may only be used for purposes of planning and rehearsing events for an upcoming public fair. Any official caught granting access for any other reason is to be issued probation for abusing this power.
- B. Misuse
  - Any aisling who is issued a seal without having approval as defined in this mandate is to have their seal revoked.
- C. Abuse
  - Any aisling who is issued a seal with approval but uses his/her venue for unapproved activities is to be banished from Mileth.

## III. Misbehavior

- A. Event Disruptions
  - Anyone found disturbing any FHC scheduled events will be removed from the fair grounds. Anyone that has been removed that is found continuing to disturb these events will be banished from Mileth.
- B. Unauthorized Entry
  - Anyone caught inside the fair grounds while the fair grounds are closed to the public with reasons other than rehearsing future events will be banished from Mileth.
- C. Criminal Code Violations
  - The maximum initial penalty for any crime committed within the fair grounds will be raised by one punishment level.

## IV. Reporting Actions Taken within the Fair Grounds

All official actions taken within the fair grounds are to be reported on the official boards. Any removals and revoking of seals are to be reported on the Judgment Board by the acting official with the date, subject and an explanation of the events that led to this action.
