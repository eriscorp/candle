# Jurisdiction Accords

This accord formalizes an agreement between all governing and sovereign territories. All territories are defined in [Section 4].

## 1) Applicable Laws

### 1.1) All aislings agree to respect and obey the laws governing any territory they enter. Failure to honour this agreement makes the offending aisling answerable to the laws of that town

### 1.2) An aisling is, at all times, answerable to and protected by the laws of the territory in which they hold citizenship

### 1.3) The mundane mandate is universally applicable to all aislings regardless of their location or citizenship

### 1.4) Territories may not prosecute an aisling for a mundane mandate violation for which Tagor's officials have already prosecuted, even if it falls under town law(s) as well

_\*\*Should (1.1) and (1.2) of this section apply to a single act, the offending aisling is answerable to both towns involved._

## 2) Official Cooperation

All governing sovereign territories in [Section 4] must cooperate with each other in the execution of warrants which require prior action, such as removal from office, in order to execute. They must also cooperate in cases in which (1.1) and (1.2) of [Section 1] both apply.

The prosecuting territory must report the applicable crimes and provide evidence of the crime as well as a description of the actions necessary to execute punishment to the appropriate official of the territory being requested assistance from. It is preferable that a copy of the judicial report be provided.

In the event any territory refuses to cooperate under the terms in [Section I] or [Section II], a knight should be contacted for further investigation in order to settle the terms or exception.

## 3) Uniforms

Uniforms are permissible in the Territories under [Section 4]. Territories in (4.1) may have policies regarding their uniforms, as long as it does not disallow other officials from performing their duties. Independent Sovereign Territories (4.2) may have special restrictions for the handling of cases in their jurisdiction.
