# Sleephunting Procedure

Sleephunting is defined as the act of using skills and or spells whilst in a trance. ((Whilst you're not present at your Computer))

Should you find a suspected sleephunter you first should find a witness (If possible.)

Once the witness has arrived you must then prove that the suspected aisling is sleephunting. To do that you must follow the procedure below.

## Procedure

((In ALL screenshots your mouse must be placed on the aisling in-order to make there name appear above there head. The text box [f screen] must also be visible every Screenshot))

- \1. You must greet the aisling by name and ask them if they are sleephunting.
  - Example: AislingA are you sleephunting?
  - ((Take a screenshot of this whilst the text is still in the speech bubble))
- \2. Take memories of the suspected aisling using skills and or spells. ((Make sure the speech bubble has faded before you take this screenshot))
- \3. If 16 Minutes ((2 Minutes)) pass without a response contact the aisling again using the same question as before but, this time in whisper.
  - ((Make the whispered question Bright Green. To do this add before question. Take a Screenshot of this whilst the whisper is still in the action bar))
  - \3a. ((If the suspect has there whispers of or Do not disturb turned on. Then you must send them a mail. The title must be "Are you sleephunting" and the body of the mail must be "NAME are you sleephunting?" Take a Memory of the mail that you sent with the "Message sent" box still there.))

- \6 If the witness agrees (Where applicable) and the suspect continues to use skills / spells then take a memory of the use of these skills / spells ((Must the after the witness's statement has faded from the speech bubble)) after this memory has been taken the suspect is considered to be sleephunting.

### Sleeptalking

Should you suspect someone of sleeptalking ((Macroed response)) first your witness must agree with you (Where applicable) & you must have proof of this.

After this you must start the sleephunting procedure again but at the end of the question requesting them to answer a simple question or say a certain word.

Example:  
NAME are you sleephunting? If not please say: Frog  
Or  
Name are you sleephunting? If not tell me what color my hair is.
