The Council is composed of an unrestricted number of Citizens of Hwarone.

The Assembly of Delegates is composed of an unrestricted number of Citizens of Hwarone.

The Delegates are the direct representative of the Aislings inside the Government and as such are responsible of writing the laws that will be brought before the Council.

The Council is ultimately in charge of the protection of the Aislings. For this reason, it controls a Military Force.

If you meet the requirments stated above then you can attempt to become a Council or Delegate.

To become a Council or Delegate you must first raise a 100million gold campaigning fund.

Once you have raised the campaigning fund you must contact a Delegate ((Via Whisper)) before you start your voting period or as soon as possible after it has started.

The Delegate will be agree 2 Public voting periods with you.

A Public voting period is a Sun during your 2 Doublemoon voting period where you have to be awake and in Hwarone's Jurisdicition. ((This is to be arranged at a time where you can be online and on the Med Server for 3 hours)).

This allows Citizens a fair chance to vote on you. In no way are you allowed to influence or attempt to influcence a Citizens vote.

The Delegate then must post your agreed public voting periods times on all Hwarone boards to inform the citizens.

Failing to attend 1 public voting period without a valid reason will result in probation should you take office.

- Section 1 : Legislative Process.
  - Step 1. Delegates post the proposals on the "Hwarone Proposals" board. They then must mail all delegates informing them of the proposal within 8 Hours ((1 Hour)) of posting the proposal.
  - Step 2. Once a proposal has been made Delegates have 24 Suns to send amendment ideas or call a meeting about a proposal.
  - Step 3a. If amendments are made the Delegate remakes the proposal (Back to step 1)

    - At least 24 Suns ((3 Days)) notice must be given before a Delegate meeting but a meeting cannot be scheduled more than a double moon ahead of the current time.

    - Although Council must be invited only delegates are required to attend.
    - Amendments and proposals are to be discussed at this meeting. If after the meeting it is decided that the proposal is ok as it is it moves onto the 4th step. If not all agree amendments are to be made and the proposal must be reposted as if new (back to Step 1).
  - Step 4. If no Delegates object in the 24 suns, the Delegate making the proposal must make a post on the "Hwarone proposal board". This post must inform the Council that they have 8 suns to read the proposal and make amendment proposals if necessary.
    - A Councilman can only vote on the changes in law made in a proposal not somthing thats already in a passed law.
  - Step 5a. If the delegates choose to make amendments based on the councils suggestions they must reposed the law. (back to Step 1)
  - Step 5b. General Meeting of Parliament
    - The Delegate making the proposal can choose to call a "general meeting of parliament".
    - If a General Meeting of Parliament is called it cannot be put up for ratification until after the meeting.
    - Both Council and Delegates are required to attend. 24 Suns ((3 Days)) Notice must be given and both Council an Delegate must be mailed informing them of the meeting. This must be done within 8 Hours ((1 hour)) of it being scheduled.
    - The Council has a purely consultative role in a General Meeting of Parliament, and ultimately the Delegates decide on the final Text.
    - If the delegates choose to make the amendments they must propose the law again. (back to step 1)
  - Step 6. If the Council has no amendments to make after 8 days then the delegate making the proposal must place the law up for ratification by the council.
  - Step 7. The Council then must vote on this proposal within a double moon of it being proposed.
    - Proposals are voted in or out of law by a simple majority vote
    - If a Councilman does not suggest amendments in the 8 day amendment period but wishes to vote against a proposal when it goes for ratification, they must mail the delegate making the proposal detailed reasons for voting against. This is because the Council does have a chance to make amendments suggestions before it goes for ratification.
  - Step 8. The Council then Post the new law or remove a law from the "Hwarone Law Board" if required based on the result of the majority vote after the double moon has passed.
    - A Councilman must archive all law before removing them from the "Hwarone Laws" board. ((Post them on the forum on the achive section [http://www.hwaronecity.info]))

    - You then must post a copy of the amendment proposal on the "Hwarone Proposal" Board and a Post showing the errors that where fixed and how they where fixed.

#### Passing of Multiple Legislation

Should a Delegate wish to pass one or more proposals to the Council for ratification they must first pass the laws normally upto step 3. Should the propsals not be objected to within 16 Suns by the delegates. The delegate making the proposal must schedule a general meeting of parliment (Step 5b.)

They must inform both council and delegates that this meeting is being called to discuss the Passing of Multiple Legislation and it must specify all proposals you are attemping to send for ratifcation.

Council and Delegates will be expected to have read all the proposals and have feedback ready to present.

Depending on the results of the meeting, the delegate making the proposals can choose to make suggest amendments (If any). Or withdraw entire proposals if they choose.

An exception is to be made if the laws being proposed are interlinked in such a way that one cannot feasibly without the other. In situations such as this the council have no choice but to vote on the multiple proposals as one.

#### Limitations of Legislation

An action is to be considered under the light of the laws in effect at the time it took place.

The laws are to be interpreted strictly. Any action not explicitly illegal, is to be considered Legal.

#### Martial Law

Martial Law is to be used in times of crisis. Laws passed during Martial law supercede all other laws with the exception of any laws passed which work in conjunction with other poltical towns. Another exception is that the rules of Martial law cannot be changed using Martial law.

((Should you have more than 1 Character in office, You are only allowed to vote on 1 Character for on all matters regarding Martial Law, This includes voting on emergency laws and supporting the declaration of Martial law and the ending of Martial Law))

To declare Martial Law you must have the support of at least 3 other goverment officials & 100% of the awake Government. Should you have siblings ((Other Characters in office)) they cannot be counted as other officials.

When Martial Law is declared emergency laws can be passed in the following way:

Council or Delegates write emergency laws.

A Delegate (If avaliable) is to post this on the "Hwarone Proposal Board."

The Goverment Memeber making the proposal must then mail the emergency law proposal to all awake officials.

To be classed as awake you must be in the lands and respond to a whispered request to vote within 1 Temuairan Hour.

All awake Government must then vote on this law right away. Although the voting period must remain open for 8 Temuairan hours ((1 hour)) on new emergency laws & 4 Temuairan hours ((30mins)) on simple amendments.

For a new law to be valid you must have the support of at least 3 other officals ((Not including yourself or other characters you may have in office)) & the majority of awake goverment officials support. The same is true for emergency law removal & Amendments

If a law passes a councilman must then post the law directly onto the "Hwarone laws" board.

All Generals & Captains must be mailed by the councilman that posts the law onto the "Hwarone Laws" Board.

Generals and Captains must enform as many Aislings as possible that there is a new law in effect and they should consult the law board. The same applys for amendments to laws.

All emergency laws passed during martial law are automatically voided and removed from the law board when martial law ends.

To end martial Law you must have the support at least 3 other officials and of 75% of the awake Government.

### Official Leave

At no point are more than 50% of the Councilmen allowed to be on leave at once.  
At no point are more than 50% of the Delegates allowed to be on leave at once  
At no point are more than 60% of the Captains allowed to be on leave at once

Leave will be granted on a "First come first served" basis.
