# Arena Jurisdiction Accord

Arena Jurisdiction is defined as: Coliseum arena, Gladiator arena and all areas contained within, including Team arena and arena circuit rooms.

Inside Arena Jurisdicition officials of Hwarone are not given carte blanche authority to enforce town laws.

Hwarone Officials may not impose an official presence in the Arena. This includes but is not limited to; Wearing your uniform or issuing a verbal warning of any kind (Criminal or Offical)

Should a citizen of noes commit a crime within the Arena Jurisdiction you must do the following:

- \1. Make a warrrant for the said crime(s) and post it on Hwarone City's Political Boards ((Post it on the "Arena warrant" section of the forum and upload all evidence. [http://www.hwaronecity.info/forum/forum/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=51] ))
- \2. Contact an arena host, and show them the evidence you have on the said crime(s) ((Send them the link to the warrant you made)) The arena host will then decide to either take the case themselfs, Give Hwarone Permision to take the case or dismiss the case entierly. If you disagree with an arena host decision you made ask one more arena host for a second decision.

In the event there is no arena hosts in the lands you may contact a ranger for crimes that break mundane mandate ((Darkages Terms of Service.))

If either a Ranger or arena host takes the case the warrnant is to be classed as fulfiled. ((Add a note to the warrant that a Ranger / Arena Host took the case and move it to the fulfiled warrants section.))

If neither an Arena host or Ranger are in the lands you, or another official of Hwarone, must contact one when they return to the lands.

Hwarone Officials cannot take action without permission unless under extreme circumstances (Mass murder ect.) and even then, if an Arena host or a ranger is in the lands, they MUST be contacted first.

## Punishing Officials

The City of Hwarone reserves the right to punish its officials for committing official crimes within arena Jurisdiction without the need for permission, providing that the City of Hwarone takes no actions whilst inside Arena Jurisdiction.
