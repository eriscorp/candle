# Sleepwalking Law

## Sleepwalking Procedure

Sleepwalking is defined as walking whilst in a trance. ((Whilst you're not present at your Computer))

Should you find a suspected sleepwalker you must then prove that the suspected aisling is sleepwalking. To do that you must follow the procedure below.

### Procedure

((In ALL screenshots your mouse must be placed on the aisling in-order to make there name appear above there head. The text box [f screen] must also be visible every Screenshot))

- \1. You must greet the aisling by name and ask them if they are awake.
  - Example: AislingA are you awake?
  - ((Take a screenshot of this whilst the text is still in the speech bubble))
- \2. Take memories of the suspected aisling walking. ((Make sure the speech bubble has faded before you take this screenshot))
- \3. If 16 Minutes ((2 Minutes)) pass without a response contact the aisling in whispers using the following format.
  - "NAME are you awake? respond or you will be arrested"
  - ((Make the whispered question Bright Green. To do this add before question. Take a Screenshot of this whilst the whisper is still in the action bar))
  - 3a. ((If the suspect has there whispers of or Do not disturb turned on. Then you must send them a mail. The title must be "Are you awake?" and the body of the mail must be "NAME are you awake? Resond now or you will be arrested for Sleepwalking" Take a Memory of the mail that you sent with the "Message sent" box still there.))
- \4. If 24 Minutes ((3 Minutes)) pass without a response take memories of the suspected aisling continuing to walk. ((The whisper question CANNOT be still in the action bar.)) at this time they are considered Sleepwalking and can be charged.

#### Sleeptalking

Should you suspect someone of sleeptalking ((Macroed response)) first your witness must agree with you (Where applicable) & you must have proof of this.

After this you must start the sleephunting procedure again but at the end of the question requesting them to answer a simple question or say a certain word.

Example:  
NAME are you awake? If not please say: Frog  
Or  
Name are you awake? If not tell me what color my hair is.

### Punishment

The punishment for Sleepwalking is arrest. ((Post Sleepwalking Arrests in the normal arrest section on the forum.))
