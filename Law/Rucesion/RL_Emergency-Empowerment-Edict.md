# Emergency Empowerment Edict

The Commonwealth of Rucesion hereby entitles its citizens to certain inalienable freedoms from harm, and rights as granted by the City and Commonwealth of Rucesion Charter. This law applies to all citizens, guests, and officials of Rucesion and to any situation within the borders of the Commonwealth, or as jurisdiction is otherwise defined within the Jurisdiction Accords with other political entities. Protocol for evidence is located in the OCC, and may also be found on the Justice Cases board. This protocol serves only as a guideline; not fulfilling the protocol is not sufficient to merit a demerit for insufficient evidence as per the IAA. Such a demerit may only be issued when the evidence is objectively inconclusive.

## 1) Misdemeanors

Misdemeanors are minor crimes, with punishment geared towards corrective action rather than punitive action. Misdemeanors should be given a formal warning. A Judicial Official may issue banishment without warning, at their discretion.

### 1.1) Board Abuse

An Aisling posting parchments irrelevant or otherwise unfit to be present on any boards within Rucesion, per the Board Usage Guidelines should be deemed as an illegal entry and be removed by a Legislator.

### 1.2) Improper Portraits or Profiles

No portrait or profile may contain elements of profanity or pornography, or other articles that contravene the Malicious Acts Law.

### 1.3) Impersonation of an Official

This includes, but is not limited to: acting in the capacity of or claiming to be an Official of Rucesion, Ranger or Knight, or sibling thereof. Furthermore, impersonating any official to harass a Rucesion citizen also falls under this clause.

### 1.4) Noise Pollution

The repeated use of the same phrase or gibberish which fills the chat log.

### 1.5) Harassment

For anything to be defined as harassment, it needs to be made clear that the action or attention is unwanted and obvious that the action fits the definitions of Harassment.  The systematic and/or continued speech, whispering, use of skills or secrets, mailing, exchanging of items, world shouts directed at the victim, with the intent to annoy or when it has been made clear that such contact is unsolicited and unwelcome is to fall under this clause. Other types of harassment may also be prosecuted within the Commonwealth of Rucesion, including, but not limited to:

#### 1.5.1) Blockading

Preventing an Aisling from moving.

#### 1.5.2) Sexual Assault

Any act which involves the unwanted use of sexually provocative or descriptive language, or sexual actions.

#### 1.5.3) Begging

Multiple requests (including, but not limited to items, gold, labor or leeching) in the same area, to either an individual or a crowd.

#### 1.5.4) Disorderly Conduct

Any Aisling who engages in a riot or intentionally disrupts a community event.

#### 1.5.5) Harassment of Mundanes

The physical attack, through skills or spells, or abusive conversation ((defined as manipulations of verbal commands which result in offensive statements from Mundanes)) with a Mundane.

### 1.6) Extortion and Coercion

Any attempt within Rucesion or against a Rucesion citizen, to compel an Aisling, through intimidation or the use of threats, to act against their will and/or in favour of the offender, or in any other way simply out of compulsion brought about by such threats, or any other form of blackmail.

### 1.7) Obstruction of Justice

Any actions aiming to prevent or attempt to prevent an official from carrying out legal action for a crime. Also, committing a crime to the escape the Loures Jail through a banishment or exile, issued by the Commonwealth of Rucesion, will create a presumption that escape was the intention. Any official that illegally aids in removing a banishment or exile will be prosecuted by this clause, as well as the IAA. A Judge is free to order an exile, lasting from four double moons to a maximum of one Deoch, per instance to anyone who defies this law repeatedly, depending on severity.

### 1.8) Petty Theft

The picking up of decorative items from events (such as weddings) or other gatherings, or the picking up of items below an Aisling's feet and subsequent refusal to return such items to their original owners. When the value of said items is considered to exceed one million coins (based on current market value), this is to be treated as Theft or Grand Theft as defined under the Felonies or Capital Crimes section of this Law.

## 2) Felonies

Any felony incurs instant banishment; thereafter the law enforcement official is to lodge evidence with a superior. If sufficient evidence exists, a felony offence should also warrant an exile of one Deoch. Judges have the ability to reduce the exile period to a minimum of four double moons, if the perpetrators show extreme cooperation with the agents of the law in Rucesion as well as a desire to correct their actions.

### 2.1) Profanity

Any words in speech, spell incantations, in writing, or created in any way, which are deemed to be profane, including but not limited to those normally banned by the mundane speech spell ((filter)).

### 2.2) Bribery

An offer or demand of money, items or other favors to affect the outcome of any political or legal action is forbidden. Providing labor to enable someone to vote is the only instance where an exchange in return for a political action is not considered bribery. The trading of votes is also not considered bribery.

### 2.3) Prohibited Trade

Advertisements, either spoken, written, in world shouts or through group banners regarding:

#### 2.3.1) Real Money Exchange

Any transaction of in-game items and/or gold, in exchange of money/items not used in Darkages, buying or selling of Gold or Gold Bars is also prohibited trade, unless -explicitly- stated that it will be bought in items.

#### 2.3.2) Transfer of Consciousness

Any transaction of character sales for in-game money, items or real money.

### 2.4) Theft

The forceful taking of an item, through deception, or by picking up from beneath the feet of an Aisling or other means not defined here, whose value exceeds 1,000,000 but is less than 10,000,000 (based on current market value), as well as the subsequent refusal to return such an item.

### 2.5) Attempted Murder

The intent or attempt to murder an Aisling. Malicious intent should be established for this clause to be in effect. Malicious intent must be unquestionable in every case of attempted murder for it to count as a felony; for example, accidental use of negative enchantments (such as Ard Cradh) during a hunt or ungrouping an Aisling do not qualify as attempted murder.

### 2.6) Catatonia

Catatonia is defined as an Aisling being unresponsive to a Rucesion Official while performing any kind of action, such as talking, walking, using skills or spells.

## 3) Capital Crimes

Any Capital Crime requires that the law enforcement official view sufficient evidence to indicate the nature of the crime and identity of the criminal before banishing. The penalties for each crime are listed in the subsequent clauses.

### 3.1) Murder

Any action leading to the death of an Aisling or a Mundane (a beggar or those who operate a shop/service) is considered murder. An Aisling found guilty of murder must be Sgathed and exiled for one Deoch. If the murder is a repeat offender, he/she shall receive a separate Sgath for each Aisling or Mundane suffering a loss of life.

### 3.2) Grand Theft

The forceful taking of another Aisling's items, or the unwilling removal of those items. This may arise through deception, false trade, or taking items from under an Aisling's feet. Any Aisling who has been found guilty of theft will first be asked to return the property. Thieves charged with robbery of items whose value is deemed by the Judge to be higher than ten million coins (based on current market value) are to face an exile of one Deoch as well as a Sgath sentence. A list of Aislings found guilty of Theft should be maintained on the Judgment Board, as well as the Community Board by the Church.
