# Commonwealth Preservation Act

The Commonwealth of Rucesion recognizes Citizenship and Political Office as privileges, and will apply the standards set forth in this Act for the admission of new citizens and current citizens who wish to assume office.

### 1) Eligibility for Citizenship

Any Aisling without criminal marks may be freely admitted as a citizen of Rucesion. Any Aisling with three or less criminal marks may be freely admitted as a citizen of Rucesion if their most recent criminal mark is at least one Deoch old. No Aisling may become a citizen of Rucesion if they bear four or more criminal marks.

### 2) Eligibility for Office

Any Aisling with criminal marks must complete an application and be approved to hold Higher Office for five Deochs. Any Aisling without criminal marks may seek and obtain higher office without approval.

#### 2.1) Application Process

An application for higher office must be opened by a legislator. The application is to be posted on the Political Discourse Board.

#### 2.1.1) Eligibility

Aislings with 3 or more criminal marks are ineligible for Higher Office at any time.

#### 2.1.2) Application Contents

The application must provide the details of each criminal mark obtained, including reason and time. The applicant must also provide a statement as to why they should be allowed to hold office, and indicate which current official will be their Advocate.

#### 2.1.3) Advocate

Any Aisling who must submit an application for higher office must find a current Rucesion Administrative Official, Knight, or Ranger who is willing to vouch for their fitness for office. This official should also provide sponsorship, if possible. Being an advocate for a person is voluntary. Applications without an advocate will be automatically declined. Eligibility for advocacy is contingent to the Integrity Assurance Act and its regulations on direct or personal involvement.

#### 2.1.4) Voting

All Administrative Officials in office while the application is open must vote or officially abstain on the application, or be charged with Dereliction of Duty as defined by the Official's Protocol Handbook.

#### 2.1.5) Application Review Duration

The application must remain open for moon. At the end of one moon, the application should be closed by a legislative official - delays in closing the application can be considered Dereliction of Duty per the Official's Code of Conduct. Approval is granted by a 2/3rds majority of all votes cast. The applicant cannot take office until the application is officially closed.

#### 2.1.6) Future Applications

An Aisling whose application for Higher Office has been declined may submit subsequent applications for Higher Office after four Deochs have passed from the most recent date they were declined.

### 2.2) Appeal Process

Applicants who are declined may submit an appeal to a Knight, within one double-moon of closure. A Knight may recommend that an application be re-opened and voted on for one moon ((3 days)), upon providing a written statement on the Political Discourse Board explaining their determination. An Appeal does not lengthen the wait period listed in section 2.1.6.

### 3) Renewal of Authorization to Hold Higher Office

Any Aisling who obtained approval to take higher office must seek a renewal of this approval every 5 Deochs from the date of their most recent approval, by submitting an application per section 2 of this act.

### 4) Authority

As the Legislature is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the citizenry, Legislators are hereby authorized by this Act to issue banishment and exile warrants upon discovery of a citizen or official in violation of section 1 or 2.1.1; these may not exceed one Deoch in duration. Judges have discretion with regards to voiding the exile warrant if the illegal citizen/official willingly renounces their citizenship and/or office, and no malicious intent can be established.

### 5) Violations

The following circumstances are considered violations of this act:

#### 5.1) Marks prior to Citizenship

Any citizen found to have obtained more than three criminal marks prior to citizenship must renounce citizenship immediately, or be exiled for a maximum of one Deoch.

#### 5.2) Marks during Citizenship

Any citizen who has obtained more than three criminal marks must renounce citizenship or face exile for a maximum of one Deoch.

#### 5.3) Marks during or after Office

If an official acquires a criminal mark while in office, they must face the consequences as outlined by the Official's Protocol Handbook and Integrity Assurance Act. Failure to present themselves for removal while they are in office will result in an exile for one Deoch, in addition to requirements in the Integrity Assurance Act.

### 6) Retroactivity

Any revisions of this law apply to all citizens and officials in its entirety, regardless of when they were admitted as a citizen or approved for higher office.

#### 6.1) Higher Office Reapproval Clause

If an Aisling was approved for higher office at any time prior to this revision, the five Deoch approval begins on the date this law was passed. Section 6.1 of this act will be invalidated by any subsequent revisions to this law.
