# Separation of Powers Act

The Commonwealth of Rucesion recognizes that each office of Rucesion is separate, and is arbitrated by a chain of command. Officials are only permitted to perform the duties of their office granted to them by law. Those who attempt to take more power than their office grants them are to be dealt with in terms of the Integrity Assurance Act.

## 1) Official Responsibilities and Chain of Command

The government of Rucesion is divided into three categories of Officials. All officials, sans Respected Citizen, are split between the Legislative and Judicial branches, and Knights and Rangers.

### 1.1) Vertical Interaction

The only permitted instances wherein the vertical chain of command may be altered and enable a subordinate to take the place of a higher office are governed by the Codes of Practice section 2.

### 1.2) Horizontal Interaction

The only permitted instances wherein the vertical nature of each branch may be overcome and enable an office from one branch to interact with one from the other are those explicitly mentioned in Rucesion Law.

### 1.3) Respected Citizen

Respected Citizens are Aislings who may admit new Aislings to the Commonwealth. They are responsible for abiding by Rucesion laws. A Respected Citizen is subordinate to all other officials of Rucesion.

### 1.4) Judicial Branch

Guards are sworn to serve and protect the citizens of the Commonwealth. A Guard's main intention is to settle a dispute, without resorting to punitive action, patrol, communicate with other officials, and attend meetings. A Guard is the subordinate of a Captain. If the office of Captain is vacant, a Deputy Captain may be appointed.

#### 1.4.2) Guard Captain

Captains perform investigations into criminals, maintain the Justice Cases Board, and request exiles. They may carry out the duties of a Guard and assist Judges. Each Guard Captain should hold one mandatory Guard meeting per term. This responsibility is foregone if another Guard meeting was held on both double-moons of their term. Additional meetings may be called with optional attendance as seen fit by the Senior Guard Captain. A Captain is the direct superior of a Guard and subordinate of a Judge. When the office of Judge is vacant the Senior Captain becomes Acting Judge.

#### 1.4.3) Judge

Judges represent the Court of Rucesion and are responsible for the safety of the town and its citizens. Judges may carry out the duties of a Captain. Their duties include organizing the Captains, monitoring the Justice Cases and Judgments boards, holding trials to determine guilt or innocence, reviewing laws, and maintaining the Exile, Pardons Due, Probation, and Bar lists. A Judge is the direct superior of a Captain.

### 1.5) Legislative Branch

It is the sole responsibility of the Legislative Branch to amend, maintain, and vote on revisions to Rucesion Law, unless otherwise specified.

#### 1.5.1) Demagogue

Demagogues maintain the integrity of the citizenry through the continual review of legislation to maintain fairness of the Commonwealth. They must attend Legislative meetings, assist the Judicial Branch with exiles and pardons and monitor board usage. A Demagogue is the subordinate of a Burgess. If the office of Burgess is vacant the Senior Demagogue becomes Acting Burgess, and board maintenance is not required.

#### 1.5.2) Burgess

Burgesses ensure the safety and well-being of Rucesion's citizens and officials. A Burgess may carry out the duties of a Demagogue. They are responsible for organising the Demagogues, holding meetings, and acting as an intermediary between Aislings and the Officials. As such, they are also the office to which the monitoring of all officials falls down to. A Burgess is the direct superior of a Demagogue.

### 1.6) Other Officials

#### 1.6.1) Mundane Representatives

These officials are appointed to their station by the Mundanes, and are to be considered citizens of the Commonwealth. Due to their status, cooperation is expected from Rucesion Officials. In the event of conflicting direction provided by Knights and/or Rangers, Rucesion Officials are to follow the recommendations of Knights and Rangers previously from Rucesion, or the Master Ranger. Both Knights and Rangers may serve as attorneys in Rucesion Trials, may request political action be delayed for up to two moons, and may request individuals be banished, upon providing evidence and a cohesive argument.

#### 1.6.1.1) Knights

Knights deal with both Aisling law and Mundane law, and may step in and investigate any situation or incident they feel is necessary.

#### 1.6.1.2) Rangers

Rangers may exercise their authority in the territory of Rucesion without fear of retribution.

### 1.7) Officials of other Jurisdictions

No other officials hold authority in Rucesion. Any request made by officials of other jurisdictions are left to the discretion of Rucesion Officials, but must adhere to Rucesion Law, even in the event of conflict with the laws of the other jurisdiction.

### 1.8) Subordination

A superior may overrule a judgment made by a subordinate without consultation. Action against a superior may be taken by two subordinates, if the superior has no peer or superior. Decisions by any official may be overruled by a Knight if they have no superior. Overruling the decision of an unrelated official is only possible when specifically legislated. It is not legal to overrule any decisions after punishment has been enacted, or when an overruling decision would conflict with the law. The only exception to this law is the immediate pardoning of current exiles, which were enacted for acts which are no longer criminal.
