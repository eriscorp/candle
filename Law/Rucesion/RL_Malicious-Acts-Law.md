# Malicious Acts Law

The Commonwealth of Rucesion entitles its citizens to certain inalienable freedoms from harm and rights. This law applies to all citizens, guests, and officials of Rucesion and to any situation within the borders of the Commonwealth, or as jurisdiction is otherwise defined within the Jurisdiction Accords. Protocol for evidence is located in the Official's Protocol Handbook, and may also be found on the Justice Cases board.

### 1) Misdemeanors

Misdemeanors are the most minor offences, and the consequences they carry are aimed at rehabilitating the defendant. Corrective action for misdemeanors is governed by the Official's Protocol Handbook, unless noted otherwise.

### 1.1) Board Abuse

Defendants posting parchments whose content is irrelevant, or otherwise unsuitable, for the board they are attached to are to be warned and have their parchments removed.

### 1.2) Malediction

This refers to defendants which are asked to stop using malediction ((skipping the Mundane filter for words which are not otherwise profane)). Seriously disruptive persistence may warrant a banishment.

### 1.3) Impersonation of an Official

This includes, but is not limited to: acting in the capacity of or claiming to be an Official of Rucesion, Ranger or Knight, or sibling thereof. Furthermore, impersonating any official to harass a Rucesion citizen also falls under this clause.

### 1.4) Noise Pollution

Persistence use of gibberish or repeated phrases which cause a disturbance ((by filling the chat log)).

### 1.5) Extortion and Coercion

The attempt to compel the victim to act against their will or in favor of the defendant, or as otherwise prescribed by the defendant. There should be evident use of intimidation, threats or other forms of blackmail.

### 1.6) Obstruction of Justice

Actions which prevent, or attempt to prevent, officials from carrying out justice. Officials who have, by malicious intent, aided in the lifting of a banishment, exile or barment are liable for prosecution by this clause as well as the Integrity Assurance Act. Committing crimes with the intent to facilitate the escape of the defendant from Loures Jail via a banishment or exile also falls under this clause - it is strongly recommended that these instances of Obstruction of Justice are punished by exile, up to one Deoch.

### 1.7) Petty Theft

The picking up of decorative items from events (such as weddings) or other gatherings, or the picking up of items below a victim's feet and subsequent refusal to return such items to their original owners. When the value of said items is considered to exceed one million coins (based on current market value), this is to be treated as Theft or Grand Theft as defined under the Felonies or Capital Crimes section of this Law. Persistent violators should be banished.

### 1.8) Blockading

Preventing the victim from moving, through any means. This includes completely surrounding or paralysing them. If it is not possible to otherwise free the victim, through the provision of songs or court summons, and defendants are unresponsive, they should be banished.

### 1.9) Begging

The repeated requests for items, gold or services, either in public or in private.

### 1.10) Disorderly Conduct

The disruption of organised events, such as weddings, political meetings, or other gatherings. Defendants may be warned or banished, depending on severity, the importance of the event, and the likelihood of persistence on their part.

### 1.11) Mundane Abuse

The physical attack or the coercion of mundanes into illegal behaviour ((such as making NPCs speak profanity or bypass the filter through verbal commands)).

## 2) Felonies

Felonies are grave crimes which severely impair or diminish the rights of the victim. Warnings for felony behavior are left to the discretion of the law enforcement official.

### 2.1) Verbal or Written Harassment

Continued contact with a victim who has clearly established that such contact is unwanted. The defendant must be asked to stop and must also be ignored ((added to the F9 list)) by the victim and must subsequently persist in contacting them through any means. This includes written parchments, world shouts, incantations, banners ((Group Boxes)) or any other means.

### 2.2) Sexual Assault

The use of sexually provocative or descriptive language or actions which is publicly visible or non-consensual.

### 2.3) Profanity

Any words, communicated through any medium, which are deemed to be profane, including but not limited to those normally banned by the mundane speech spell ((filter)).

### 2.4) Bribery

An offer or demand of gold, items or other favors to affect the outcome of any political or legal action is forbidden. Providing labor to enable someone to vote is the only instance where an exchange in return for a political action is not considered bribery.

### 2.5) Currency Laundering

The exchange of goods or services provided in Temuair for the currency, goods, or services of other lands which are not recognised as legal tender by the Mundanes ((Transactions involving real money/items/services in exchange for items/gold/services in Temuair)).

### 2.6) Transfer of Consciousness

Transactions which involve the transfer of one Aisling's consciousness to other parties ((The sale of characters or accounts for either in-game or real world items, currency or services)).

### 2.7) Theft

The acquisition of an item through deception and against the wishes of its genuine owner, whose value exceeds that of one million coins (1,000,000) but is less than that of a gold bar (50,000,000), based on current market value. The defendant should first be asked to return the item; if they persist in keeping it, they should be prosecuted.

### 2.8) Attempted Murder

The documented attempt to murder a victim, driven by malicious intent as established by a Judge. Accidental use of negative enchantments (such as Ard Cradh) during a hunt or the removal from a group are not sufficient to establish an attempt to murder.

### 2.9) Catatonia

Catatonia is defined as the defendant being unresponsive to a Rucesion Official while performing any kind of action, such as talking, walking, using skills or spells ((sleephunting, autowalking, botting, and other automated actions)).

## 3) Capital Crimes

Capital Crimes are the most serious of offenses able to be committed against a victim. Law enforcement officials may exercise discretion if a warning is appropriate.

### 3.1) Murder

Any action leading to the death of an Aisling or a Mundane ((non-hostile NPC)) is considered murder. A defendant found guilty of murder must be Sgathed and exiled for a minimum of one Deoch. The defendant should be given as many Sgaths as the number of casualties they have inflicted.

### 3.2) Grand Theft

The acquisition of an item through deception and against the wishes of its genuine owner, whose value exceeds that of one gold bar (50,000,000), based on current market value. The defendant should first be asked to return the item; if they persist in keeping it, they will be prosecuted. The defendant should face an exile of one Deoch in addition to a Sgath sentence.

### 3.3) Contravention of Sgath

Any Aisling who escapes death by the Sgath Wraith will be re-summoned to the pit until they are slain. Any individual who cannot escape the Sgath Pit after a successful summoning may be banished or summoned to court upon completion of the Sgath.
