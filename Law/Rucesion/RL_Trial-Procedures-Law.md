# Trial Procedures Law

Court Trials are the last resort wherein disputes within the Commonwealth of Rucesion may be brought to a solution. They are an instrument which can be used to hold the Commonwealth and its officials accountable, and ensure the prevalence of the rule of Law and the maintenance of Justice.

## 1) Trial Eligibility

Only issues outlined here are eligible to be brought before court. Trials are not to be formed at whim and should be handled with professionalism.

### 1.1) Legal Impasse

When the officials responsible for the prosecution of a violation of Rucesion Law cannot agree on a conclusion through other means, a trial may be held. This is particularly apt for Political Code Violations for which a Review Panel cannot reach consensus.

### 1.2) Civil Code Violations

Any Civil Code violations, for which the punishment is set at an exile or above, may be contested at a trial. The defendant should have the support of a Judge or Burgess as well as that of another Judge or Burgess, or a Knight to be eligible for this procedure.

### 1.3) Undefined Disputes

Disputes and crimes not otherwise defined by Rucesion Law, for which consensus cannot be otherwise reached, may be brought to trial.

## 2) Requesting a Trial

The Aisling concerned should contact a Judge in writing, formally requesting a trial and providing as much information about the case as possible. Supporting evidence and names of relevant witnesses should be attached. The request should clearly determine the identity of the Aisling's preferred representative; this should be a Rucesion Administrative Official, Knight or Ranger. The defendant should also indicate whether they would like a trial by jury, or the judge.

## 3) Trial Formation

The Judge may accept or decline any request for trial as outlined in this law. Should the request be accepted, the Judge may name a prosecutor and defendant from among the ranks of the two sides involved, as appropriate. The prosecution is defined as the side which wishes to press charges of any nature; the defense is defined as the side which wishes to prove these charges baseless.

### 3.1) Insufficient Evidence

The Judge may decline any otherwise eligible request for trial should it fail to present sufficient evidence for a legal challenge.

## 4) Trial Schedule

The Judge may propose a date for the trial. The prosecution and the defense each have a moon's notice to propose an alternative date should this date not be acceptable to them. This process should be overseen by another Judge or a Burgess to ensure that the final date does not favor either of the involved parties.

### 4.1) Trial in Absentia

If the Judge cannot agree on an acceptable date to both parties, a trial in absentia may be carried out. Absent parties forfeit their rights to appeal or challenge any decisions, unless sufficient justification is provided for their absence. The Judge is given discretion to annul the trial should neither party be present.

#### 4.1.1) Testimonies in Absentia

Witnesses who cannot be present at the trial may provide their unadulterated account of the relevant events to the Judge in writing.

#### 4.1.2) Unjustified Absence

Absence (of a witness, prosecutor or defendant) from a trial can be considered an Obstruction of Justice if it is not justified in advance, as per the Malicious Acts Law. All Judges must agree that the absence constitutes Obstruction of Justice, and no less than three Judges are required. In the absence of the minimum amount of Judges, Burgesses and Knights may substitute. The absentee should be given a moon's notice to provide acceptable justification, if any.

## 5) The Judge and the Jury

The Jury, if there is to be one, is to judge the case using the trial proceedings to determine guilt or innocence. If there is to be no Jury, the Judge assumes all Jury responsibilities.

### 5.1) Formation

The Jury is to consist of at least five, but no more than ten, upstanding Aislings known for their neutrality in the affair and their upstanding behaviour. They may not possess any criminal marks. At least half should be citizens of Rucesion, but the Jury should ideally encompass as wide a selection of backgrounds as possible.

### 5.2) Informed Judgment

The Judge must make the Jury aware of the charges, and the laws related to them, at the start of the trial.

### 5.3) Neutrality

The Jury must be bound to the Judge ((they should all be in a group)) and they should not be in close contact with any Aisling that is not in the Jury except for the Judge ((they should have the do not disturb status on)). In return, the Judge should also only be able to communicate privately with the Jury ((by having the do not disturb status on)).

### 5.4) Private Audience

The Jury may request a private audience with the Judge at any part of the trial ((through group chat)), and may communicate with the Judge by writing to them ((mail)) should this request be accepted. The Judge is responsible for keeping memory of all these communications.

### 5.5) Clarification

The Jury may ask the Judge to ask for clarification of any points raised at any point in the trial ((through group chat)).

### 5.6) A Judge should define "Innocence" and "Guilt", the options each juror will be voting with, as is appropriate for each trial. Many times, the two may simply be different sentences, rather than absolution versus conviction. The Judge should confer with the prosecution and the defense and define these according to each side's goals.

## 6)Trial Proceedings

The trial may proceed when all involved parties have arrived. Objections may be raised by either the Judge or one of the two sides during these proceedings.

- The Judge should outline the summary of charges and relevant legislation to the charges, and proclaim what innocence and guilt will mean in the context of the specific trial.
- The Prosecution may make an opening statement outlining the reasons for pressing these charges.
- The Defense may then make their opening statement, claiming either innocence for those charges or mitigating circumstances that requisite a different punishment than the one prescribed by law.
- The Prosecution will be given the chance to interpret all evidence, or testimonies, and question all witnesses, first. The Defense may then do the same. This process may be repeated once more, if deemed necessary by the judge.

- The Prosecution is to then make their closing statement, summarising all of the proceedings of interest to them. The Defense may then do the same.

## 7) Verdict

After the proceedings are over, the Jury may commence its deliberations. Once each juror reaches a personal decision, they may exit the jury box and lodge their vote of guilt, innocence or indecision. The Judge is to gather and tally these votes. The Judge is able to cast a vote if a tiebreaker is required. The Judge is to then present the appropriate sentence, or lack thereof, to the defendant.

## 8) Trial Minutes

A brief summary of all court proceedings is to be posted on the Judgments Board as soon as possible, within eight suns, of the conclusion of the Trial. The Judge is responsible for providing this.

## 9) Trial Invalidations

### 9.1) Mistrial

Due to the complex nature of trials and their procedures, all charges of political code violations regarding trial proceedings should be referred to a Review Panel. Violations by the Judge, or other Aislings involved in their official capacity, may be deemed either procedural, ethical or criminal, on a case by case basis, as per the Official's Code of Conduct. Violations of the Civil Code by any parties involved with or in attendance at the trial may be dealt with by the appropriate officials, save for the presiding Judge.

### 9.2) Annulment

Any trial violating any part of this law may be immediately annulled and its findings voided. A committee made up of another Judge or a Burgess as well as any available Knights or Rangers is to determine whether the conclusions of the trial are valid despite not adhering to the correct procedure. Another trial may be held should a different Judge wish to preside it. Otherwise, the case will be considered ineligible.

### 9.3) Clemency

In the event that a verdict is reached which violates the spirit of Rucesion Law, the Senior Legislator may absolve the defendant of legal recourse, such as Sgath or Exile, with a 3/4ths majority of support from the Legislature. A vote for clemency must be supported by a Knight.
