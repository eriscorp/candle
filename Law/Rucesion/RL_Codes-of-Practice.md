### ​5) Customary Decorum

Many traditions exist which are common among Officials. These tend to originate as vestiges of old laws which no longer apply or merely common courtesies, but they are not legally binding. As an example, it is customary for any official to notify that they took office, though this is not always mandatory. Please consult the rest of Rucesion Law should you question whether observed behaviours are legally required.
