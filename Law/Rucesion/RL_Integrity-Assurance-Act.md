# Integrity Assurance Act

## 1) Official Investigation Procedures

The Commonwealth of Rucesion hereby grants itself the ability to investigate its officials, in order to better serve the public. Any office holder whose performance is brought into question is granted the right to defend their actions, utilizing any past cases of precedent in legal decisions (which must be verified) as reason for aberrant behaviour.

### 1.1) Rights

The city of Rucesion and its people have the right to a polity run by officials of integrity. Officials being investigated under this act likewise have the right to a fair investigation. The Commonwealth of Rucesion recognizes two categories of Rucesion Law: Civil and Political. Officials are expected and required to adhere to both.

## 2) Hierarchy of Corrective Actions

Corrective actions must follow an order of escalation. Unless otherwise specified within the Integrity Assurance Act, the progression of corrective actions begins with Informal Warning, Demerit, Probation, and ends with Political Bar. Review Panels are the only process in which this progression may be superseded.

### 2.1) Persistence of Authority

Officials are responsible for actions taken during their term, even after expiration of their term. For purposes of the Integrity Assurance Act, the in-term superior or peer will be considered the superior of an out of term official that has not taken office. However, the in-term superior may defer to the defendant's future superior to take action, if desired.

## 3) Protocols for Corrective Actions

### 3.1) Demerits

A Demerit is a report made against an official suspected of a Political Code violation. In the event of a suspected Political Code violation, a demerit will be issued. A demerit may only be revoked by the issuing official, or overturned by a peer of the issuing official. A peer may only revoke a demerit if: the demerit is found to be illegal, new evidence invalidates the demerit, or reevaluation of the demerit. Demerits expire after one Deoch after their instatement.

#### 3.1.1) Issuance of Demerits

A copy of the Demerit notice must be placed on the Justice Cases board, as well as mailed to the official in question. After a period of one moon, in which the accused may respond with their reasons either verbally or in writing, or not at all, the demerit is considered finalized according to the decision of the investigating official. If the response is deemed inadequate, the demerit is to remain on the Justice Cases Board. In the absence of an explanation for the violation(s), the official waives all rights to appeal the findings of the demerit.

#### 3.1.2) Dormant Demerit

A dormant demerit may be issued as otherwise outlined in this law. Dormant demerits are issued in the same way as other demerit. A dormant demerit is not considered a demerit for any purpose, unless the defendant accumulates another dormant or normal demerit within one Deoch. If such an event occurs, all their dormant demerits acquired in the past Deoch are converted into normal demerits.

### 3.2) Probation

Probation is the occasion where a Rucesion Official is being closely monitored. They are subject to stricter rules, set by their Superior or a Review Panel, for a set amount of terms in higher office, subject to the Panel or to the Superior's discretion. Probations may also be warranted by an Official's Superior at their discretion, once two demerits have been accumulated by an Official. Any probation that results from the accumulation of only two demerits may not exceed two terms of higher office in length.

#### 3.2.1) Limited Probation

Limited probation allows for a superior to dictate terms in which a probated official may act without first consulting a peer; all other duties require the probated official to contact a superior, or an official designated by a superior. These conditions must be posted on the Justice Cases board, and cannot restrict an official from voting on proposals, attending meetings, receiving sponsorship or performing acts of notification. A limited probation must not be greater in limitation than full probation.

#### 3.2.2) Full Probation

Any official who is placed on full probation cannot give sponsorship or take official actions without first consulting a superior, or an official designated by a superior. Voting on proposals, meeting attendance, receiving sponsorship or acts of notification are exempt from this restriction.

### 3.3) Political Barments

A political barment prevents an official from attaining political office within Rucesion. Political barments are in effect regardless of whether they are enacted or not. The Senior Burgess may exercise discretion on if a political barment will be officially enacted on the defendant's legend. No substitutions are allowed in this instance.

#### 3.3.1) Standard Political Bar

A Standard Political Bar is defined as any political bar two or less Deochs in length. Once the bar expires, if no additional crimes or circumstances which would warrant extension have occurred, the bar may be removed.

#### 3.3.2) Semi-Permanent Political Bar

A Semi-Permanent Political Bar is defined as any political bar lasting for a term of three or more Deochs in length. Once the barment has expired, the individual must face a Review Panel to see if the bar must be extended or removed.

### 3.4) Removal from Office

The act of removing an individual from office. The only procedure for removing an individual from office is outlined in this act. Removal is only permissible when prescribed by the Official's Code of Conduct or as per article 3.4.2 of this law, or when deemed necessary through a review panel, as per article 4 of this law. Removal warrants may be ordered by an Official's Superior, or an entire Review Panel, and automatically become void if they are not carried out before the defendant's current term expires.

#### 3.4.1) Rehabilitation

Every warrant of Removal from Office must be accompanied by an order for Standard Political Barment and two terms of probation. For officials which are deemed sufficiently incorrigible defendants, Semi-Permanent Barments may be ordered through a Review Panel. All officials who wish to return to office after a period of Political Barment have to go through a Review Panel which will evaluate their suitability for return to political life as well as the terms of their probation.

#### 3.4.2) Undefined Termination of Office

In the event that an action or inaction calls for termination of office that is not covered by the Integrity Assurance Act, the accused official must first face a Review Panel which will deliberate possible corrective action. If convicted, the name and definition of the action must be submitted to the Legislature for review for inclusion in the Official's Code of Conduct.

## 4) Review Panels

Whenever circumstances call for complex investigations, or as otherwise required by the political code, a Review Panel may be called to deliberate the crimes committed and the possible corrective actions.

### 4.1) Formation

Review Panels may only be organized by a Burgess, or Acting Burgess. They should consist of the organising Burgess and at least three others drawn from different offices, in this order of priority: Another Burgess, a Judge, a Demagogue, a Knight, a Ranger. The defendant should be given a moon's notice to agree to a suitable schedule for their Review Panel, which should take place at least a moon after the defendant provides such agreement.

### 4.2) Requesting a Panel

Panels may be organized whenever prescribed by this, or other, legislation. However, they may also be requested by either a defendant or prosecutor for matters of political code violations. Review Panels are intended to provide flexibility to the letter of the law so that the spirit of the law is preserved, through a consensus of senior political figures.

#### 4.2.1) Rights of the Defendant

Defendants accused of wrongdoing as per the Official's Code of Conduct, the Integrity Assurance Act or any other part of the Political Code, have a right to request a review panel. Therein, they may explain any mitigating and extenuating circumstances which requisite a punishment other than what would normally be prescribed by the law.

#### 4.2.2) Rights of the Prosecution

Prosecuting officials may find that the nature of the violations of the Political Code committed by the defendant would be insufficiently dealt with as prescribed by law. In such an event, they have the discretion to request a review panel to increase (or decrease) the significance of the punitive actions against the defendant.

### 5.4) Undefined Misconduct
