# Dubhaimid Hero
_by Tmander in_ ___Dark Ages___

Hek!! When i was a smal shadow in the ruins of Tascarnach, Pops used to tell us about Grathwretch!!  
The BIGGEST HERO for all the dark ones!  
He wasn’t like the other Ghasts just gruntin an dribblin no he was SMART kinda and brave too!  
We all laffed but Pops said "HE BEAT THE LITE ONES YOU WATCH" and I was like YEA OKAY PAPS SURE.  
But this is the storie I herd (or maybe i made up part of it but who cares!)  

## 1 (:: The rock that shined ::)

Grath wasn’t Grathwretch at first he was just Grath.  
A dum Ghast who livd in a hole full of mud and bones.  
He only grunted and stomped and chewed on old boots (gross but thats Ghasts for ya).  
BUT THEN ONE DAY he found somthin AMAZING!! It was a SHINY ROCK. 

The rock was black and glowy and had scribbly marks on it like some smart person rote on it (maybe magic writin or just cool doodles idk).  
Grath picked it up and went "HHHRK!!" and the rock went "ZAP!!" and BAM!  
Now Grath’s eyes were glowy too!!! 
Pops said the rock told him "BECOME A HERO OR WHATEVER" but it probly just went zap zap and Grath thought "OK COOL."  

From that day on he was Grathwretch THE ROCK WIELDER!

## 2 (:: The light rats in Farrasidh ::)

Grathwretch got bored in his mud hole and decided he would go on a big ADVENCHUR.  
He stomped all the way to Farrasidh, the spooky ruins where the LITE RATS were EVERYWHERE!  
They were shiny and glowy and they made squeak-squeak noises like "HAHA WE'RE BETTER THAN YOU!" (I HATE THOSE RATS!!!).  

So Grath went into the ruins and he GRUNTED REAL LOUD like "HRRRRKKK!!" and the rats were like "EEK A DUMB GHAST!!" but Grath wasn’t dumb anymore (kinda).  
He smacked them with his shiny rock. SPLAT SPLAT SPLAT. But then a GIANT RAT (the boss rat?) jumped out and bit his arm!!!  

Grath screamed "HHHRRRRRRHHHHH!!" and smashed his rock into the ground and BOOM!!  
The whole ruin went all dark and spooky and the rats RAN AWAY. Pops said Grath ate the big rat after that but idk if that’s true.  

## 3 (:: The city of Rucesion ::)

After he beat the rats, Grath was like "HKKRKRR ADVENCHUR NOT DONE" and decided to go to Rucesion, the shiny city of the LITE ONES.   
(Grath HATED them they were too clean and bright!)   
He snuck in all sneaky-like but he wasn’t good at sneaky so he just grunted a lot and hoped nobody noticed.  

Grath found a big sword in a church (Pops said it was a HOLY sword but Grath didn’t care).  
He grabbed it and started lickin it like "HRRK YUM."  
That’s when a PALADIN showed up all shiny and yellin somethin heroic like "STOP EVIL MONSTER!!"  

But Grath just stared at him with his glowy eyes and bonked him on the head with the sword.  
The Paladin ran away SCREAMIN and Grath just stood there gruntin like he won a medal. 

## 4 (:: The sacks of rats ::)

Grathwretch got bored of Rucesion real fast (too many candles!) so he went back to Dubhaimid Castle.  
All the other dark ones were like "OOO GRATH COOL ROCK!!" and Grath was like "HRRRK PLAN!!"  

Grath started catchin all the light rats from Farrasidh and stuffin them into sacks.  
Then he handed the sacks to everyone and grunted at them like "HKKKRRKK THROW THESE!!!"   
Nobody knew what he meant but they did it anyway (Grath was the boss now obv).  

When the Dubhaimid threw the rat sacks into Rucesion, the city went CRAZY.  
The rats squeaked and ran everywhere, eatin shadows and stealin food, and the Lite Ones were screamin like "OH NOOO!!!"  
Grath just sat outside the city gates swingin his shiny rock and gruntin like he was laughin "HHHRHRHRHKK!!"  

## 5 (:: Where is Grath now? ::)

Nobody knows what happend to Grathwretch after that.  
Pops says he’s still in Dubhaimid Castle, stuffin rats into sacks and plannin to take over the world.  
But maybe he went to find a BIGGER shinier rock (he was kinda obsessed with rocks lol).  

If you ever go to Farrasidh or Tascarnach, you might see stuff he left behind, like smashed altars or glowy rat guts.   
And if you listen real close, you might hear a low, spooky "HHHRRKKK..." in the shadows.  

Grathwretch, the Dubhaimid Hero. The best hero of the dark ever!!!  

END?? OR MAYBE NOT...
